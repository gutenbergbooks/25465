<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Likewise a Declaration of Principles</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>UNTIL the first great disillusions of his
youth, the Bedelle Foot Regulator and the
Mosquito-Proof Socks, had brought a new sentimental
need of consolation and understanding,
Skippy Bedelle's opinion of the feminine
sex had been decidedly monastic. During the
first twenty-five years of their existence, he regarded
them as unmitigated nuisances, and
pondering on them, he often wondered at the
hidden purposes of the Creator. Later they
might possibly serve some purpose by marrying
and adding to the world's supply of boys.
In a further progress, a sort of penitential
progress, they became more valuable members
of society, as maiden aunts who tipped you on
the quiet, and grandmothers who mitigated
parental severity and knew the exquisite art of
ginger snaps, crisp and brown.</div>

<p>But before the skirted animal, which resembled
but was quite unlike a man, had atoned
for the error of her birth, Skippy refused to
take her seriously. There were boys even
younger than he who wore girls' jewelry, who
wrote and received what were called "mash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
notes," and who flaunted these sentimentalities
openly. He knew such incomprehensible males
did exist. There were three on his block and
he had thrashed them all soundly and been
thrashed for having thrashed them, which of
course convinced him in his biblical estimate
that women were created for the confusion of
man.</p>

<p>Skippy's prejudice was of long root. From
an early age he had been afflicted with sisters;
one older and one younger, and he could find no
mitigating circumstances between the sister who
could hit you and could not be hit back, who
never romped without pretending to howl, and
the sister who put you at your ease when you
had tripped over the parlor rug, by asking
publicly:</p>

<p>"John, have you washed <i>behind</i> your ears?"</p>

<p>The thought of girls was inalienably connected
in his memory with unnecessary washing
up; with boring parties; with stiff collars; with
unending polishing of shoes; humiliating walks
down the avenue, stammering, idiotic phrases,
while from every window the eyes of malicious
friends were set in mockery. Girls never slid
down the banisters or fell out of apple trees, or
snapped garter snakes, or raised white mice or
collected splinters coasting down the icehouse
roof. Girls were always spruced up and shining;
always covered with pink ribbons and waiting
for callers; always dressing and undressing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
always kissing their worst enemies in public
instead of giving them a dig in the ribs or
treading on their toes and whispering under
their breath:</p>

<p>"Wait till I catch you outside; I'll tear the
hide off er yer!"</p>

<p>Girls spoiled vacations. It was on account of
girls, to give them something to do, that dancing
schools were invented; that pews in churches
were stiff and uncomfortable; that ministers
stormed and threatened until the hour hand
had gone its round. In a word, wherever life
was drab, or stiff, or formal, wherever prohibitions
intervened to check the young impulse,
wherever the policing principle showed itself,
at the bottom somewhere the feminine sex must
be the cause.</p>

<p>Gradually, of course, some mitigation came
to this inveterate contempt; gradually he did
begin to distinguish between girls as such and
women. He saw that some such line of demarcation
must be drawn but it was still confused
and hazy. Later on it was undoubtedly true
that woman must play some part in a man's
life; this much he gathered from novels and the
ways of those giants to his imagination, the
great Turkey Reiter and Charlie de Soto.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly in the long process of evolution
from the clam to the stripling, morality was the
contribution of the imitative monkey period
each boy passes as he merges towards perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
manhood. A thousand supplications, commandings,
and exhortations cannot accomplish what
the spectacle of a Turkey Reiter or a Charlie
de Soto or a Dink Stover instantly achieves in
its casual Olympic passing. Such, with all due
respect to the efforts of secondary education,
are the real moral forces of youth.</p>

<p>When therefore Skippy had made choice of
his heroes and slavishly set himself in imitation,
he had been unpleasantly disturbed by
their evident friendliness to the sex he despised
and after much mental perturbation perceived
that sooner or later he, too, would share the
common lot and actually take pleasure in explaining
to something pink and white, with
large rolling eyes and smiling teeth, that the
game of baseball is played with a ball and a bat
and that the fielder and not the batter is chasing
the ball, that the difference between baseball
and football is that a baseball hurts the hands
and a football hurts the foot.</p>

<p>Some day when he grew to be Captain of the
Eleven like Dink Stover undoubtedly he would
condescend to be gazed at and flattered and
fondled. If Dink Stover could stand the way
Tough McCarthy's sister hung on his arm and
flirted openly before the whole school&mdash;why of
course in permitting such a display of affection
Dink Stover was right, for Dink Stover could
do no wrong. Some day, then, like his hero, he
would condescend to be adored. Some day his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
turn would come as they sang at the immortal
Weber and Fields:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For I must love some one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And it may as well be you."</span><br />
</div>

<p>But all this was in the uncharted future.
His attitude toward the sex was still the attitude
of normal soap-defying boyhood, defensive
and belligerent. Yet all this was to change, in
the twinkling of an eye, in one short season.
The first great disillusionments of youth were
at hand and woman with the mask of sympathy
and understanding waiting to fashion the man
out of the urchin. By what ways, ludicrous and
tragically comic, this sentimental progression
was achieved is here set down in reverent
reminiscence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<h2>SKIPPY BEDELLE</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fate in a Bathtub</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THERE comes a moment when without
warning boy and puppy instantaneously
pass into the consciousness of manhood. With
the young canine it comes with the first deep-throated
defiance of the intruder, the instinct
that the wriggling, fawning days are over and
that the moment to attack and accept attack
has arrived. With the human puppy the change
is more elusive. To some it comes with the
first clinging splendor of long trousers, to
others with the first hopeless love, when at the
tragic age of fifteen the world, fate and the
disparity of ages intervene. But usually this
transformation, all in the twinkling of an eye,
from the hungry slouch of boyhood into the
stern and brooding adolescence, comes with the
discovery of a controlling idea. Without any
apparent cause, some illuminating purpose descends
on the imagination, the future opens,
and in the vision of a future Napoleon, a P. T.
Barnum, a millionaire or a predestined genius
the man emerges.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
When Skippy Bedelle at the age of fifteen
years and three months, in the warmth of early
Spring, rambled across the green stretches to
his appointed rendezvous with Compulsory
Bath, he went as a puppy sidles to an undetermined
purpose, with a skipping, broken motion,
occasionally halting for an extra hitch at
the long undisciplined trousers. A cap rode
on the straw-colored shock of hair which hung
like weeds over the freckled, sharp nose and
the wide and famished mouth. Once the idea
occurred to him to turn a cartwheel, and he
promptly landed sprawling on his back, picked
himself up, skipped forward a dozen steps,
stooped to tighten a shoe lace and arrived
breathlessly before Doc Cubberly, who was eyeing
him, watch in hand.</p>

<p>Thirty seconds later he was contemplating
the tips of his toes from the warm and delicious
water, yielding to the relaxing ecstasy of pleasant
day dreams. He had no quarrel with water
as such, though from principle and to remain
regular he rebelled against the element of compulsion,
but water, particularly warm water,
brought him a quickening of the imagination.</p>

<p>Now between water as such and bath, particularly
compulsory bath, is all the difference
between the blue freedom of the sky and the
allotted breathing space which is enclosed in
a cage. There was something peculiarly humiliating
and servile in being forced to soap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and water three times a week under penalty of
having your name read out before a tittering
schoolroom&mdash;<i>Absent from Bath!</i> It vaguely
recalled medieval days and such abominations
as the inspection of ears and the prying intrusion

<p>Skippy was aware of all this and publicly
voiced his indignation at the despotic practice.
To have done otherwise would have been to
draw down a storm of ridicule. There are certain
traditions in school life as firmly established
as the doctrine of infant damnation in
the good old days of theology. Secretly, however,
Skippy adored the first warm contact of
the tentative toes, the slow ecstasy of the
mounting ripple over the sinking body and the
long, drowsy languor of complete submersion.
It was the apotheosis of happiness when all the
aches and vexations of the day disappeared in
a narcotic reverie, when he could forget the
scorn of the Roman, flunking him; the jibes of
Slugger Jones, the rigorous discipline of Turkey
Reiter and the base ingratitude of Dennis
de Brian de Boru Finnegan, who had refused
him the price of a jigger, with pockets that
bulged with the silver he had loaned him.</p>


<p>"Well, I'll be jiggswiggered!"</p>

<p>Skippy looked up hastily to perceive the unwashed
features of Slops Barnett peering over
the partition in set disapproval.</p>

<p>"Hello, Slops!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing that for?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?"</p>

<p>"Getting into it," said Slops in an angry
whisper. "You're a nice one, you are!"</p>

<p>Slops' method of rebellion, which antedated
the hunger strike, was to submit to a superior
authority so far as outward appearances required.
But once safely behind a locked door,
he employed the minimum of ten minutes in
simulating the bathing process by immense disturbances
in the bathtub, produced without recourse
to disrobing processes, while gleefully
chanting:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mother may I go out to swim?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yes, my darling daughter.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hang your clothes on a hickory limb</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But don't go near the water!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Don't go near, don't go near, don't go near the water!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Publicly Skippy stood pledged to this uncompromising
defiance of the Powers That Be,
so with Slops Barnett's accusing glance on him,
he answered hastily:</p>

<p>"I caught an awful cold and got to steam it
out!"</p>

<p>"Faker!"</p>

<p>"Honest, Slops."</p>

<p>At this moment a dripping sponge came spinning
through the air and struck the young
irreconcilable squarely between the shoulders.</p>

<p>"If Pee-wee Davis threw that sponge I'll
skin him alive," announced Slops wrathfully.
Instantly the air was filled with flying sponges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Towels, like dripping comets, passed and re-passed,
while Doc Cubberly came hobbling in,
threatening, imploring and dodging stray
missiles.</p>

<p>Skippy, safe below the surface, watched this
bombardment swing over head, die out and
silence return. One by one his fellow prisoners
emerged, vociferous, hilarious, and passed
moist and voicing imprecations into the outer
region. Still Skippy continued gorgeously to
steam and doze.</p>

<p>Then a sharp rat-tat-tat on the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bedelle?"</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc!"</p>

<p>"Time's up."</p>

<p>"All right, almost dressed. Coming fast."</p>

<p>The crucial moment had arrived, the tragic
end to all happiness below, that inevitable
moment when he must, by some supreme exercise
of the will, rise out of this blissful warmth
and stretch a reluctant arm through the chilly
air to let in the cold water. End of dreams
and chill return of reality! He temporized.
A second time Doc Cubberly's sliding step
arrived.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bedelle&mdash;Mr. Bee-delle!"</p>

<p>"Just buttoning on my collar, Doc!"</p>

<p>For the hundredth time, one foot slowly
emerged and five over-civilized toes sought in
vain to turn the round faucet labeled "Cold."
A hundred, yes a thousand times, he had attempted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the apelike expedient before the final
mental determination to rise out of the warm
spell into the frigid air.</p>

<p>"Gee, if I could only turn that with my foot,"
he said. "Lord, what a cinch that would be!"</p>

<p>He tried a last ineffectual time, jerked up
precipitately, shot out his arm, let in the cold
water and dodged back below the surface.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Birth of an Idea</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TEN minutes later he sidled out of the bath
and, having balanced Doc Cubberly's Grand
Army hat on the gas jet, and simulated an
attack on Tippy, the black and tan, escaped before
the guardian of the bath could return to
the rescue of his pet.</div>

<p>"All the same, you ought to be able to work
a bathtub with your foot," he said as he went
skipping towards the village with heightened
appetite. "Gee, that <i>would</i> be scrumptious!"</p>

<p>Suddenly a queer thought came to him.
After all&mdash;why not? All you needed was a
foot regulator, to let in the hot and cold water
gorgeously, at your ease and inclination! Foot
regulators! Why not? There was something
in that idea surely.</p>

<p>"Gee, what a cinch that <i>would</i> be!"</p>

<p>If man in his age-old struggle with nature
could harness the force of steam to his service
and ride the air, why should he not be master
of his daily comforts?</p>

<p>"I don't think a foot regulator would be so
ding fired hard to invent," he said, meditating.</p>

<p>The idea had begun to work, though as yet
the vast scale had not opened to his tender imagination.
Now in youth when an idea begins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to grow it brings sharp animal appetites. To
contemplate properly this new entrancing
thought, he repaired to that first station on the
hunger route, which was known as Laloo's
Kennels, where fragrant hot dogs sent their
tantalizing invitation from bubbling tins.</p>

<p>"Two ki-yis and easy on the mustard."</p>

<p>Mr. Laloo prospered because Mr. Laloo dealt
on a strictly cash basis. He was languidly tired.
One foot rested on a soap box, one arm rested
on the upholstered divan he had exchanged
with the late Hickey Hicks for a hot dog a day
in the lean month of December, and his head
drooped over the supporting toothpick. Mr.
Laloo never made an unnecessary motion or
uttered a superfluous word. So he continued
without apparent notice to conserve the feeble
energy which ran low in his burnt-out eyes.</p>

<p>Skippy looked at Laloo and understood.
Freshmen might argue but even the Tennessee
Shad wasted no time in producing the coin.
There was exactly ten cents in Skippy's pocket
after the most painstaking search revealed this
last ray of hope in the lining of the threadbare
pocket. Only ten cents to stop the deficit in his
stomach! The choice was difficult. There was
ginger-pop at Bill Appleby's, and jiggers at
Al's, pancakes at Conover's, and the aching
void within him knew no prejudice or limitations
to its hospitality. He hesitated, but the
fragrance in the air was maddening&mdash;besides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
there was always the chance of a friend in
funds. He fingered the coin regretfully and
laid it on the counter with a heavy heart. He
might argue with Bill and plead with Al, but
Laloo had the soul of a pawnbroker.</p>

<p>"There's the bank roll, pick out the fat
ones!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later, with his nose buried in a
fragrant sandwich, elbows on the counter, he
returned to The Great Idea. Suddenly the
sublimity of the conception smote him. Think
of lolling languidly under the surface and regulating
the temperature at will with only the
exposure of a foot! Think of the gain to humanity
in the added daily comfort! The idea
was stupendous, colossal! It beat even Dink
Stover's famous Sleep Prolonger, the Alarm
Clock, which automatically closed the window
and opened the hot air register at the designated
hour. And out of the world, out of the
whole human race, present and past, he, John
C. Bedelle, was the first to stumble upon this
revolutionary fact! An accident? Perhaps&mdash;but
so was Galileo's discovery of the telescope
an accident. When the gnawing appetite had
been placated (somewhat placated, but not convinced),
the Skippy Bedelle who descended
Laloo's steps, with grave and thoughtful face,
had emerged from the warm skin of the urchin,
with the consciousness of manhood's call to
service.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Macnooder Opens Vistas</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TO Skippy's credit be it recorded that the first
impulse was humanitarian. For the second
was distinctly mercenary. But then Skippy
lived in a materialistic age and Skippy's father
owned a department store. Yet the practical
and profitable possibilities did not proceed
from any inward contamination of the generous
impulse of invention, but from contact and suggestion.
At Bill Appleby's, where he wandered
in hungrily, in a desperate hope of meeting
some friend whose memory could be jogged by
reference to past favors, he perceived the celebrated
Doc Macnooder in earnest conclave with
Appleby, to whom he was offering to sell the
Lawrenceville rights of his latest invention, the
Folding Toothbrush. Given Bill Appleby's
natural canniness, and Macnooder's hypnotic
eloquence, the discussion was apt to be long
and difficult, so Skippy hovered at a respectable
distance with ears at attention.</div>

<p>At this time, due to a rift in the lute (a little
matter of expert accounting on a joint operation),
the firm of Macnooder and the Tennessee
Shad had been dissolved and each financier had
assumed an independent and belligerent attitude.
The Shad had a certain adroit and devious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
imagination, but the practical mind was
Macnooder. His point of view was purely
economic. Hickey might plan the daring man&oelig;uvre
which made the conquest of the clapper
possible, and revel in the faculty's amazement
at the sudden silence of the tyrant will. Macnooder
would have proceeded to capitalize this
imagination by fabricating clapper watch
charms and selling them at auction prices. The
Gutter Pup might organize the sporting club in
memory of the lamented Marquis of Queensberry;
Macnooder sold the tickets and extinguished
the surplus. His ambition was not
to be a philosopher, or a benefactor. He announced
openly that he intended to be a millionaire,
and among his admiring victims there
was much speculation as to just how far he had
gone in the accomplishment of his heart's
ambition.</p>

<p>When Skippy moved into an eavesdropping
position, the situation was this: Bill Appleby,
having carefully closed and locked the cash
drawer, was braced with both arms extended
against the counter, eyeing Macnooder with a
look of steely negation that expressed a settled
conviction to doubt instantly any statement
whenever or however made. Macnooder's
round capuchin body was drawn up in confidence
and ease and the smile on his face was
bland as he remarked:</p>

<p>"Bill&mdash;get my proposition; let it percolate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sift down and settle. But, Bill, make no mistake.
The Macnooder Folding Toothbrush is
a fact&mdash;patented and financed! I'm not asking
you to take stock,&mdash;no, Bill, no." He
shook his head and said with friendly regret&mdash;"I
couldn't, Bill; not in fairness to myself&mdash;not
in fairness to my family. Why, Bill, if you
were to get in on the ground floor, you'd buy
a yacht in five years, live on Fifth Avenue and
marry Lillian Russell."</p>

<p>"Go slow," said Appleby huskily, for Appleby
was a bachelor.</p>

<p>"Well, watch <i>me</i>," said Macnooder with a
wave of his hand that played among the rubies
and emeralds floating in his imagination. "Bill,
I'd like to put you in&mdash;I can't&mdash;that's flat.
I can't! Why, Bill, if you put your hand in
your pocket this moment and took out that little
green wallet of yours and said: 'Mr. Macnooder,
this is your account&mdash;it's nothing&mdash;I
dismiss it, I tear it to pieces&mdash;you are my
guest from now on; let's start right;&mdash;what
will you have?' If you should say that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't!" said Appleby, shrinking from the
hypnotic caress in the financier's manner.</p>

<p>"If you should do that <i>and</i> should take out
a nice new one hundred dollar bill&mdash;you have
one, Bill, right in that old leather wallet&mdash;don't
shrink, Bill, your alarm pains me&mdash;if
you, now, here in Lawrenceville, New Jersey,
John C. Green Foundation, should produce that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
one hundred dollar bill&mdash;slap it on the counter,
shove it into my face, force it into my pocket,
beg me to give you a little interest&mdash;<i>no!</i> No,
Bill, no! I'd refuse&mdash;I'd <i>have</i> to refuse.
Don't build up any false hopes, Bill, don't."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Appleby, yet already a sense
of great personal loss had begun to invade
him.</p>

<p>"All I can let you in on are the regional
rights&mdash;the Lawrenceville rights&mdash;for ten
years. I might, I don't say it flat,&mdash;I want to
consider,&mdash;but I <i>might</i> extend them to Princeton.
It's a gift, but I might. And do you know
why I'm giving you this opportunity of a lifetime?"</p>

<p>"Why, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Because, Bill, I don't want to break you.
I don't want to have to run you out of business.
That's friendship, but there's more. I can use
you," said Macnooder magnanimously. "You
have the qualities I shall need in my future
operations&mdash;I suffer from them now but I appreciate
them. You will make an ideal watchdog
of the dollar, and when the dollar leaves
your hand, Bill, there won't be a rim left to it.
Bill, let's do business&mdash;it's more than just
the toothbrush, it's a whole future's open to
you. Bill, the moment is yours. Choose!
Fifth Avenue, a yacht, box at the opera&mdash;Lillian
Russell!"</p>

<p>Appleby fumbled in his pocket and drew out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a cigar to break the spell, and the hand that
held the match trembled.</p>

<p>"Wall, now," he began cautiously, "to-morrow's
to-morrow, and toothbrushes is
toothbrushes. And say&mdash;gettin' down to
tacks&mdash;who in Sam Hill ever wanted a folding
toothbrush, nohow?"</p>

<p>Macnooder's fist descended on a shivering
glass counter as he cried triumphantly:</p>

<p>"Say that again!"</p>

<p>"Wall, who does want a folding toothbrush?"
said Appleby, in a more bellicose
manner.</p>

<p>"Bill, your hand!" said Macnooder, matching
the gesture to the exclamation. "Straight
to the point. Keen&mdash;Gad, you're devilishly
keen! That's you, Bill, no one can beat you
at seeing the kernel at once! Who wants a folding
toothbrush? No one!" said Macnooder,
folding his arms and beaming with delight.
"Is there any reason any one should? There
is not. Can you imagine anything more unnecessary,
idiotic or useless than a folding
toothbrush? Don't try&mdash;you can't. That's
the beauty of it. But, Bill, make no mistake&mdash;that's
where you get the heterogeneous sucker!
Has there ever been a folding toothbrush!
Never! That's where they bite! Think of it&mdash;no
one's ever had one before. How do they
know whether they want one until they've tried
it? They've had a bicycle or a kodak, but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<i>folding toothbrush</i>, Bill&mdash;think what it means!
Get the sound of it. Why, Bill, it's sunk into
your imagination already! You've got the
hankering yourself. You have. I can feel it!"</p>

<p>"Wall, now, I would sorter like a squint at
one."</p>

<p>"And you shall," said Macnooder, reaching
into his pocket. But at this moment he stopped,
perceiving Skippy, who, lost in wonder, was
listening, all ears.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Doc, honest, I couldn't
help hearing," he said hastily.</p>

<p>"This is a private conversation," said Macnooder
severely.</p>

<p>"I say, Doc," said Skippy, gazing at the
package which had come forth from an inner
pocket, "I say, Doc, can't I just have one look
at it?"</p>

<p>"You can <i>not</i>," said Macnooder, whose hand
indicated the exit in the classic gesture of melodrama
when the cruel father dismisses the
penniless lover.</p>

<p>Skippy drew a long breath, hesitated and
went slowly out. But what a world had opened
before him! It was something to be a benefactor
of humanity, but why not tap the wealth
of the Incas! If the mere invention of a folding
toothbrush could open the sacred precincts
of Fifth Avenue, what realms beyond the
dreams of avarice were waiting for him who
should revolutionize the bathtub!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Loneliness of Great Men</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE course of his meditations suddenly
halted before the Jigger Shop. They were
all there; the fortunate possessors of dimes and
nickels, gluttonously, selfishly gorging themselves
with juicy creamy strawberry, coffee,
and chocolate jiggers; clinking their glasses,
licking their spoons&mdash;and he, John C. Bedelle,
the future Bathtub King, without a cent in his
pockets! The irony of it! If they only knew,
what sycophants would fawn upon him! Then
an idea came to him&mdash;at such moments alone
can man read the secret heart of humanity.
He would make a test of true friendship.</div>

<p>He passed through the outer rapturous fringe
of hungry boyhood and slowly approached the
counter where Al, guardian of the jigger,
dished out the jiggers and watched the counters
with uneasy eye. Not that he had any hope,
but it was only fair to give even the most
abandoned of mankind a sporting chance.</p>

<p>"Hello, Al!"</p>

<p>"I see you, Skippy."</p>

<p>The tone was not encouraging. Bedelle determined
on direct methods. He turned his
pockets deliberately inside out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I see you."</p>

<p>"Anything doin'?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doin'," said Al, stroking his corn-colored
mustache with that languid finality
against which there was no appeal. "Nothin'
at all."</p>

<p>"He has had his chance," said Bedelle to
himself in gloomy pride. Yes, Al had had his
chance, that one chance that comes unwittingly
to every man&mdash;Al who might have toured the
world with him as his majordomo, or his confidential
valet.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dennis!" he said, perceiving back
of an enormous chocolate &eacute;clair the human anaconda
famine and opportunity had at this moment
made of Finnegan, the discoverer of the
double adjective.</p>

<p>"Hello yourself!"</p>

<p>"How's the bank account?" said Skippy
lightly, for etiquette forbade any reference to
the half-dollar parted with on the Wednesday
before.</p>

<p>"Why, bless my immortal soul, you old
rambunctious, skipping Zockarooster, are you
setting them up?" said Brian de Boru, pretending
to misunderstand.</p>

<p>Skippy disdained a reply. Al, after all, was
but running true to form, but this was the
basest ingratitude,&mdash;the serpent's tooth in the
fair landscape of friendship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he'd at least offered to share that &eacute;clair
I&mdash;I could&mdash;" said Skippy to himself, and
then stopped in silence before the future Finnegan
had thrown to the winds. For he liked
Dennis and Dennis <i>would</i> have made such an
ideal publicity man.</p>

<p>He passed like a poor relation at a wedding
feast, and as he passed with many a stammered
hint, and eloquently pleading eyes, his faith in
his kind began to ooze away. Of course it was
the end of the month, yet of twenty friends who
had fed from his hand, when his hand had been
hospitable, not one stirred to the commonest of
human impulses. And so gloomy, alone and
misunderstood, like the young Napoleon at
Brienne, John C. Bedelle, with the consciousness
of future greatness, moved out from the
uncomprehending crowd. At the door Toots
Cortrelle arrived with unmistakably jingling
pockets, and seeing him, cried with the zest
of young hunger certain of gratification:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Skippy, old sockbutts!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't lend me a quarter or a dime, could
you?" said Skippy solemnly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You can, Toots&mdash;you can, honest?"</p>

<p>"With ease and pleasure. This is the way
it is done," said Toots, who proceeded to transfer
a quarter from his pocket to the astounded
Skippy, with the classic manner of a prestidigitator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's happened?" said Skippy, feeling
that the situation demanded some explanation.</p>

<p>"Maiden aunt and birthday," said Toots joyfully.
"Al, take Mr. Bedelle's order and make
mine a triple jigger, coffee with chocolate
syrup!"</p>

<p>When ten minutes later, gorged and sated,
with his faith in humanity somewhat restored,
Skippy separated from his benefactor, he
turned to Toots and said solemnly:</p>

<p>"Old friend, I shall remember this!"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;turn about's fair play. Ta-ta
and so long," said Cortrelle, all unsuspecting
of the future Destiny had built up for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, some day I <i>shall</i> remember," said
Skippy solemnly to himself. And as he trudged
back to his room at the Kennedy, there to map
out the future operations of the Bathtub Trust,
he allowed his imagination to dwell delightfully
on that momentous future date when the debt
of friendship should be paid. He saw himself
in a gorgeous marble-lined office, protected by
an outer fringe of obsequious secretaries, a box
of expensive cigars on his shining mahogany
desk, and before him in respectful attention
Toots Cortrelle, now grown a man, but worn
and wasted with the buffeting years, and he
saw the light of hope spurting upward in the
tired eyes as he heard himself saying:</p>

<p>"Cortrelle, once long ago, you did something
I told you I should remember. You have forgotten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it. I never forget. For that I am going
to put you in charge of my whole South American
trade at a salary&mdash;" Here Skippy paused
somewhat perplexed before continuing, awed at
his own munificence&mdash;"at a salary of over
<i>three thousand dollars</i> a year!"</p>

<p>But just as Toots with tears in his eyes was
starting to grasp his hand, Skippy's foot
tripped over a step and he rolled ignominiously
down the terrace and fetched up in a heap
among the gravel.</p>

<p>"Oh, please do it again!" said the voice of
Snorky Green from an upper window.</p>

<p>"You go to blazes!" exclaimed Skippy, rising
wrathfully. But all at once his anger left
him. Snorky Green was his roommate and
partner of his secrets, and the secret that had
been locked up within him these last momentous
hours simply had to be told.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Golden Shower</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TEN minutes later Snorky Green was standing
in a daze, one hand on an open Bible,&mdash;taken
for the occasion from the room of the
Pink Rabbit,&mdash;and gazing into the flushed
countenance of his roommate, who was saying:</div>

<p>"Snorky, are you a Christian?"</p>

<p>"Say, what do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter&mdash;you believe in God!"</p>

<p>"Sure I do."</p>

<p>"Then swear!"</p>

<p>"Swear what?"</p>

<p>"Swear never to reveal to man, woman or
child what I am about to disclose to you."</p>

<p>"I swear!"</p>

<p>"As I am a Christian and believe in God."</p>

<p>"As I am a Christian and believe in God."</p>

<p>"And if I do may God strike with his afflictions
those I love best&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it."</p>

<p>Snorky reluctantly subscribed to this terrible
oath and five minutes later the Secret was his.</p>

<p>"Great Jehosophat!"</p>

<p>"Do you see it?"</p>

<p>"Do I see it?" Snorky tore from his throat
the collar that was stifling him. "My aunt's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
cat's pants!" he said solemnly. "Skippy,
we'll be billionaires!"</p>

<p>"We'll buy a yacht and live on Fifth Avenue,"
said Skippy, who for sentimental reasons
suppressed any reference to Lillian Russell.</p>

<p>"Say this is so big we've got to take every
precaution," said Green, whose imagination
was on more practical lines. "No one must
even suspect until we've got this drawn up
and patented."</p>

<p>"That's what worries me."</p>

<p>Snorky Green cautiously opened the door
and investigated the hall, then returning
drew up his chair and said in a confidential
whisper:</p>

<p>"Skippy, when this goes through every bathtub
in the country will go in the scrap heap.
Think of that!"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that."</p>

<p>"It'll do what the pneumatic tube did to the
bicycle."</p>

<p>"What the trolley did to the horse-car!"</p>

<p>"It's revolutionary."</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Enormous!"</p>

<p>"Stupendous!"</p>

<p>They shook hands and Skippy, bursting with
happiness, said impulsively:</p>

<p>"Old friend, whatever I make&mdash;you're
down for half."</p>

<p>"No, no. Two-thirds to you&mdash;one-third to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
me," said Snorky, as C&aelig;sar putting from him
the proffered crown.</p>

<p>"I won't have it&mdash;share and share alike,"
said Skippy in a rush of emotion.</p>

<p>"But, Skippy, do you realize what even
one-third will mean!" said Snorky, in a voice
trembling with the vision of the future.
He went nervously to the desk and returned
with pad and pencil. "Write down these
figures."</p>

<p>"Ought we to?"</p>

<p>"We'll destroy it afterward. Put down
ninety-two million."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The population of the United States."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;ninety-two it is."</p>

<p>"Divide that by&mdash;by&mdash;well let's be conservative."</p>

<p>"It's better."</p>

<p>"Let's say there's one bathtub to every
fifty-five inhabitants."</p>

<p>"I think that's too conservative."</p>

<p>"We mustn't let our imagination run away
with us," said Snorky. "One in fifty and then
we're safe."</p>

<p>"Well, let's say two million bathtubs," said
Skippy, who disliked figures, and felt the first
promptings of avarice.</p>

<p>"So be it. Two million bathtubs and on
every tub our royalty!"</p>

<p>"What'll we ask?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you suppose a bathtub averages!"</p>

<p>"Say fifty dollars, at ten per cent,&mdash;that
would be five dollars coming to us."</p>

<p>"Five dollars, but Skippy, isn't that exorbitant?"</p>

<p>"You forget we'll be in a position to dictate."</p>

<p>"Holy Maria!"</p>

<p>Under 2,000,000 he wrote the figure five and
slowly noted the colossal result.</p>

<p>"Do you realize what that means?"</p>

<p>"It means ten million dollars!"</p>

<p>"No, it means more than that&mdash;it means
that if the Bathtub Combine came to us to-day
and offered us a million dollars&mdash;it would be
suicide to accept it!"</p>

<p>Skippy's eyes dilated with excitement.
Slowly he tore the sheet of paper in two.</p>

<p>"Burn it&mdash;take no chances," said Snorky,
who proceeded to light a match.</p>

<p>"And that's only the United States," said
Skippy in a whisper.</p>

<p>"There's Canada and the British Empire!"</p>

<p>"But Englishmen carry rubber tubs with
them."</p>

<p>"They can be educated."</p>

<p>"The French don't bathe," said Skippy
mournfully.</p>

<p>"That'll come."</p>

<p>"Holy cats, Rockefeller won't be in it!" said
Skippy, who was suffocating. "Snorky, what
I said goes! Money isn't everything. No&mdash;sentiment's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bigger. Fifty-fifty, I said, and
fifty-fifty it stands!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll put money into it," said Snorky,
offering his hand. "I'll go to my father. But
not now&mdash;not a word until we get the patent.
If any one gets the idea we're lost!"</p>

<p>Skippy jumped at the sound of Butsy White's
elephantine descent of the stairs.</p>

<p>"And Skippy," said Snorky Green, with a
sudden realization of a man's frailties, "whatever
you do&mdash;never tell a woman. You understand?"</p>

<p>Skippy, whose relations with the opposite
sex were of the cat-and-dog variety, solemnly
raised his hand.</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"Now to be practical. I say, Skippy, we do
have to invent the regulator, you know."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Methods of a Financier</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>WHEN, after a dream-ridden night, Skippy
started across the campus to morning
chapel, the urchin's wabble had gone from his
legs forever. He moved with firm and measured
tread, shoulders thrown back and head erect,
every inch a man, and his glance was set into
the future with proud recognition of his place
in the complex scheme of things. The imagination,
which returns after the sense of humor,
was still drowsy with the painful waking effort
in chapel, but as he proceeded to Memorial
Hall, the glittering future approached a little
nearer. Some day he, John C. Bedelle, would
return to the old school a patron and a benefactor!</div>

<p>"They ought to have a gymnasium," he
thought, appraising the campus in a burst of
generosity. "I'll give it to them. I'll give
them a gym that'll beat anything hollow. I'll
give them the finest architect in the country.
I will! And when it's all built and ready to
dedicate&mdash;" But all at once as he started to
visualize himself before the applauding crowd
Snorky Green jogged his elbow:</p>

<p>"Skippy&mdash;Gee, I've got it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;sh! You know&mdash;the invention!
Meet me in the room after first recitation.
Mum's the word!"</p>

<p>A little unworthy feeling of jealousy came to
Skippy at this announcement; almost a feeling
of having been defrauded. Yet after all he had
only himself to blame. The temptation of the
future had beguiled him from the present necessity.
He slid into his seat, conveniently protected,
by the broad back of Tubby Banks, from
the searching gaze of Lucius Cassius Hopkins,
better known as the Roman, who presently
would number him among the flunked. Then
when the attack centered among the R's and
S's, across the room, he drew forth a pencil and
attacked the problem of a practical foot regulator.
But immediately the deplorable deficiency
of his education struck him. What preparation
had he for his life's vocation? Of
mathematics he knew absolutely nothing! The
priceless years had been squandered on mere
Latin, English prose, French verbs and the
vexing grammars.</p>

<p>"I must have a scientific education," he said,
drawing rough outlines on the margin of
C&aelig;sar's Gallic Wars. "How in the deuce am
I to begin? A foot's sort of different. Shall I
make it a button to press on or a sort of slipper
to push up and down?"</p>

<p>There was a cut of the famous bridge across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Rhine, but a hurried examination brought
him no comfort. He looked over at Snorky
across the aisles and Snorky winked back at
him in the triumph of achievement. Still if
Snorky was to share in the fabulous returns it
was only right that Snorky should contribute
to the practical details! The truth is that
Skippy in calmer mood had already begun
to regret the impulse of the day before.
Five million dollars after all was a good deal
to give away in a gesture, even to the chum
of chums!</p>

<p>"What the deuce got into me?" he thought
gloomily. Until that moment the sinister corruption
of money had been foreign to his nature,
but all at once a change came to his outlook.
"Gee, even a third would have been a
<i>whale</i> of a sum!"</p>

<p>He rose and flunked horribly in an attempt
to classify an ablative absolute and answered
"unprepared" when the Roman, maliciously
pressing his advantage, insisted on his translating.
Then with sulky dignity he strode to
the blackboards with the B's and C's and the
D's and flunked once more on the conjugation
of an irregular verb. What time was this for
trivial annoyances when his whole soul was rent
with the thought of the millions which he had
squandered for a moment's sentimental impulse!
He was not ashamed of that impulse,
no&mdash;but, all the same, Snorky, if he had had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
finer feelings, would never have abused his
generosity!</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said the chum of
chums, when, recitations over, they had gained
the secrecy of their bedroom. "You look positively
bilious."</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep much," said Skippy, eyeing
him with intuitive disfavor.</p>

<p>"Well, for Heaven's sake brace up; you look
as though you'd swallowed a porcupine!"</p>

<p>"All very well for you to cheer up," Skippy
thought to himself. It hurt, there was no turning
from it. It did hurt. What a blunder he
had made!</p>

<p>"I could have hired him on a salary," he
thought gloomily. But of course now there
could be no backing out.</p>

<p>"Well, now what have <i>you</i> worked out?"
said Snorky triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I? My mind has been concentrating on the
business organization."</p>

<p>"Gaze on this!" Snorky proudly brought
forth a diagram which to Skippy's bewildered
gaze looked like the cross section of a switch
yard. "Do you get it?"</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>"That? Why that's the bathtub, you
chump."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look like any bathtub."</p>

<p>"You're in it, looking down&mdash;see, this is the
line of the water. Here's the hot and cold&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"But this and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's your legs, of course. You're in the
tub looking south. Your legs stick out, don't
they, and these are the foot regulators&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They look like feet."</p>

<p>"They are feet&mdash;that is, your feet stick in
'em."</p>

<p>"But how does it work?"</p>

<p>Snorky produced another scrawl.</p>

<p>"This is a cross section, you see. Works
both ways. This you work with your hands.
Then you turn it on here with this catch,
and your foot regulators come into play&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"It's awfully complicated."</p>

<p>"Ought to be."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cause if you just had an attachment to put
on the spigots, you mightn't get more than a
dollar a tub."</p>

<p>"He's thinking of the money," thought
Skippy, darkly.</p>

<p>"You don't seem enthusiastic."</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;."</p>

<p>"I say, Skippy, you aren't natural," said
Snorky in alarm. "You don't look at me as
you used to. What is it? Out with it now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Skippy slowly, "I said fifty-fifty
and I stick to it; fifty-fifty, because I am
a man of my word, but I do think there ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>to be some limit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, when Snorky's infectious
laugh had restored his sense of humor, Bedelle,
Incorporated took up the transaction of business
again,&mdash;the discussion of the profits having
by mutual consent been adjourned to a later
session.</p>

<p>"Skippy, old top, I'm thinking we've got
to get expert advice," said Snorky after a
morning of fruitless discussion.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean Doc Macnooder or the Tennessee
Shad."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, too. This is bigger than
us."</p>

<p>"It's a hard choice."</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;and we've got to be protected."</p>

<p>"You bet we've got to be protected."</p>

<p>"Well, if we must choose between Macnooder
and the Shad, which would you rather trust?"</p>

<p>"Trust no one," said Snorky, finding it impossible
to establish this distinction. "And
say, Skippy,&mdash;oaths on the Bible are all right,
but if we're going to let Macnooder in on this
he's got to sign a paper."</p>

<p>"You betcha!" said Skippy, with whom a
little of Bill Appleby's distrust remained.
"A paper's the thing!"</p>

<p>That afternoon, after due ceremony, the door
was closed and locked and Doc Macnooder inducted
into an easy chair. Skippy producing
the Bible said firmly:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Doc, you've got to take the oath; never to
reveal to man, woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I'm a Unitarian," said Macnooder,
examining the St. James version.</p>

<p>The point was debated and passed over.
Snorky then produced a formidable document
tied in green ribbons with large wax seals,
stamped with a cameo stick-pin.</p>

<p>"You'll have to sign this, too."</p>

<p>"Sign what?"</p>

<p>Snorky read rapidly:</p>

<p>"I, Doc Macnooder, in my third form year,
Lawrenceville, New Jersey, hereby testify that
on this date, the 12th day of April, 1896, the information
written on the back of the present
sheet of paper was communicated to me by
John C. Bedelle, the rightful and lawful inventor,
and the document does hereby establish
all his rights. Signed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what's on the other side?" said
Macnooder, with rising curiosity.</p>

<p>"That can only be communicated to you after
your signature."</p>

<p>Macnooder was wary, but Macnooder was
inquisitive. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully
and considered.</p>

<p>"Is Dink Stover in this, or the Tennessee
Shad?" he asked cautiously.</p>

<p>"Not a soul besides us two has the slightest
suspicion."</p>

<p>"All right then&mdash;I'll sign."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Skippy, you tell&mdash;" said Snorky Green
generously, "the glory is yours."</p>

<p>"It's an invention that's got to do with a
bathtub, with all bathtubs," said Skippy, with a
sudden faintness of confidence before the professional
agnosticism which Macnooder, the man
of affairs, now assumed by crossing his legs and
donning a large horn-rimmed pair of spectacles.</p>

<p>"The word is <i>bathtub</i>," said Macnooder,
who not to appear too eager dug a knife from
his pocket and carefully whittled at the end of
his pencil.</p>

<p>"It's a foot regulator!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Macnooder, who didn't understand
at all.</p>

<p>"You see, Doc, what's the matter with all
the bathtubs of to-day," said Skippy, picking
up courage, "your head's at one end and the
faucets are at the other&mdash;and, that's an awful
distance!"</p>

<p>"Good point!" said Macnooder, nodding.</p>

<p>"Now when you want to let in the cold water
you've got to sit up, reach down and turn it on
and that's cold and chilly and drafty as the
mischief, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's a very strong point," said Macnooder,
who began to see.</p>

<p>"Now, if you could only turn the faucets with
your toes, you could lie quietly under the hot
water, couldn't you?.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you can't&mdash;but
you could if you had foot regulators. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
isn't it the simplest thing in the world to have
foot regulators? Only no one has ever thought
of it before?"</p>

<p>"Think what it would do to the bathtub industry,
Doc," said Snorky, who felt the preceding
explanation had failed properly to illuminate
the epochal quality of the invention.
"Why, Doc, we'd have 'em by the throat.
We'd put every bathtub out of existence. The
whole dinged system is fossilized and we'd
show 'em up with the first exhibit. Do you see
it, Doc? Do you get the possibilities?"</p>

<p>"At first sound," said Macnooder, who kept
his glance on the end of his pencil, not to reveal
how much his imagination had been stirred,
"at first sound, it interests me strangely.
Skippy,&mdash;Mr. Bedelle, your hand, and my congratulations."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Doc," said Skippy, with a lump
in his throat, "you really do believe in it, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"My boy, there are gold mines in it," said
Macnooder, carefully, "the wealth of the Sultan
is nothing to it, or&mdash;or it isn't worth a
plugged nickel."</p>

<p>Skippy and Snorky exchanged glances of
sudden dismay.</p>

<p>"It's one or the other. That's what I will
find out."</p>

<p>"How'll you do that?" said the roommates,
in a breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall write for catalogues first. I may
have to conduct a personal investigation at the
patent office&mdash;and of course I must look at all
possibilities. The idea is revolutionary," said
Macnooder, reviving their spirits. "Mr. Bedelle,
nothing can deprive you of that distinction
and glory. Your fame is secure. But the
bank account? Can we protect ourselves
against pirating? Can the Bathtub Combine
avoid in any way, shape or manner, being
forced to treat with the owners of the Bedelle
Foot Regulator? That's what I must carefully
consider. Gentlemen, one week from to-day
I promise you my answer."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>will</i> take it up, Doc?"</p>

<p>"If everything is all right we incorporate
Bedelle, patent the foot regulator, organize a
stock company, and I shall accept the posts of
President and Treasurer, with fifty-one per
cent of the stock."</p>

<p>"Fifty-one per cent, Doc!"</p>

<p>"My invariable terms. The responsibility
and the control must be mine. I don't ask
fifty-two per cent, or fifty-three per cent. I
ask only protection. Take it or leave it."</p>

<p>Skippy gazed at Snorky, who pondered a
long while, but Macnooder's professional manner
sunk deep into their imaginations.</p>

<p>"You don't trust us!" said Skippy sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Business is business!" said Doc, pointing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the documents he had signed. "Did you
trust me?"</p>

<p>"I sort of expected we'd all go cahoots,"
said Skippy reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Fifty-one per cent, gentlemen, or good
day," said Macnooder pompously.</p>

<p>"Take it," said Snorky.</p>

<p>Skippy drew a long breath. It had been a
day of disillusions. What millions had slipped
away! Truly the lot of the inventor was hard!</p>

<p>"Well?" said Macnooder, rising and shooting
his cuffs. "Is it or is it not?"</p>

<p>"It is," said Skippy heavily.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," said Macnooder
briskly, "I make no promises. I shall examine
the scheme ruthlessly, without sentiment or
prejudice&mdash;but perhaps, likewise who knows!&mdash;Gentlemen,
your hands, this moment may be
historic!"</p>

<p>Caught by the sudden inspiration of how
history might some day look back to these
humble beginnings, with a common gesture they
rose and clasped hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tragedy</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>BEDELLE, Incorporated! John C. Bedelle,
The Bathtub King! For a delicious week
Skippy sailed into the future on the magic carpet
of his imagination. He dreamed through
the long dull hours of recitations; he dreamed
when huddled in sweater he watched the scurrying
of the baseball candidates; he dreamed
over the prunes at breakfast and the prune
whip at night, and in his soft and delicious bed
he lay awake for hours planning out the disposal
of his future wealth.</div>

<p>The week ended, as all weeks must. At precisely
five o'clock in the afternoon, with that
fine sense of ceremony that was his, Doc Macnooder
knocked at the door and entered.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Snorky Green and Skippy in
joyful chorus.</p>

<p>"Your hats and follow me!" said Macnooder
in his best Dramatic Club manner.</p>

<p>The tone sent a chill down their backs.
Silently, already prepared for the great catastrophe,
they filed across the campus, to the
Upper House. Not a word had been spoken.</p>

<p>"We will now proceed to examine the Fourth
Form baths," said Macnooder, in the same
lugubrious voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Utterly and instinctively without hope Skippy
clutched his roommate's arm and stumbled
down the stairs. Something was coming, something
that meant the end of all! Macnooder,
entering the first bathhouse, flung back the
door and pointed to the bathtub.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bedelle, there is your answer!"</p>

<p>"Jerusalem, the faucets are in the middle!"
said Snorky, recoiling with a gasp.</p>

<p>"The Bathtub Combine has us beat!" said
Macnooder. "If we patented the Foot Regulator
every bathtub in the country will have
the spigot fastened in the middle."</p>

<p>"Why in Sam Hill didn't you think of that?"
said Snorky, turning indignantly on the inventor.
He kicked at the offending tub, scowled
at Skippy and deserted on the spot.</p>

<p>"And this is the friend I'd have made a
millionaire!" said Skippy to himself in the
bitterness of his trial.</p>

<p>"You see, Bo?" said Macnooder, descending
from his pedestal, as he perceived how the revelation
had crushed the younger imagination.</p>

<p>"I see, Doc."</p>

<p>"It's no use, is it?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;damn 'em, they've got us beat!"</p>

<p>"Now, old sport," said Macnooder kindly,
"don't mope about it. Your ideas are all right
and I'm here to keep you practical. Better
luck next time, but be sure and come to me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doc," said Skippy, through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
whose dimmed eyes the fatal bathtub seemed
to advance like a juggernaut. He escaped and
went dizzily across the Campus and sat on the
steps of Memorial Hall, gazing out gloomily
at the dotted recreation fields. The great Bedelle
gymnasium, which but yesterday was outlined
in splendor against the sky, was now
cinders and dust, Fifth Avenue further off than
Africa, and as for Lillian Russell&mdash;</p>

<p>"Looking all over for you, Skippy," said a
familiar voice.</p>

<p>Before him stood Toots Cortrelle.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," he said heavily.</p>

<p>"Are you flush? I thought if you were&mdash;that
quarter you know&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said I should remember," said Skippy,
with a hollow laugh. There was just twenty
cents in his pockets that an hour ago had been
heavy with millions. He drew out two dimes
and tendered them.</p>

<p>"Here's the best I can do, Toots. I'll try
to get that other nickel to you to-morrow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">When Friends Prove False</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>COMMONPLACE minds are crushed by defeat;
great imaginations rise to profit.
Ten days after Skippy Bedelle had seen the
gilded fabric of his future greatness collapse
with the failure of the Foot Regulator to revolutionize
the bathtub industry the spirit of invention
had risen triumphantly from the ashes
of first disillusionment. After all, there were
other services to render to humanity, and the
mind that at the age of fifteen could have reasoned
so brilliantly in theory must inevitably
express itself with profit to the race and to his
own individual bank account.</div>

<p>At first Skippy's depression had been profound,
and as the sensation was new he enjoyed
its sensual charm to the fullest. He discarded
the jaunty cap for a slouch hat which
he pulled down over his eyes; he selected the
soberest of neckwear, turned up his collar, sank
his fists in his pockets, and spent solitary afternoons
among the ruins of the Carthage of his
imagination, seated on the site of what would
never be the John C. Bedelle Gymnasium. Even
the spectacle of Cap Keafer knocking out a
home run in the ninth inning brought him no
rapturous exultation. He was akin to <i>Ivanhoe</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the disinherited knight, and <i>Athos</i> of the brooding
sorrows. The world had receded from him,
and nobody cared or noticed. He was alone,
misunderstood, without a friend in the world.
For after what had happened he could never
again feel the same towards that basest of ingrates,
Snorky Green.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The evening after the collapse of the Bedelle
Foot Regulator, Incorporated, there had been
a short and exceedingly painful interview.</p>

<p>"Well, Skippy, old top," said Snorky, who
was genuinely contrite and ready to make the
advance, "that certainly was hard luck. I feel
just as bad as&mdash;" Here he stopped before the
sudden majestic indignation which confronted
him.</p>

<p>"Green!" said Skippy, frowning.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Green, when you thought I was going to be
a rich man," continued Skippy icily, "there
was nothing you wouldn't do for me. You
fawned on me. But when I had to face defeat&mdash;at
the first test&mdash;you deserted me with
sneers and gibes. That is not friendship.
Green, you are not capable of true friendship,
and you have proved it. I shall never forget
and I shall never forgive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, Skippy!" said Snorky. "What's
the use of rubbin' it in? I'm not as bad as all
that!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Green," said Skippy, working himself into
the scene which he had rehearsed a dozen times
as he had long debated whether to address the
offender as Mr. Green, "Green, we will have to
go on rooming together but I wish you to understand
that nothing you can ever do or say will
change my feelings now towards you. Nothing!
Whatever communication is necessary from
now on between us, will be in <i>writing</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"In writing," said Skippy firmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if that's the way you're going to
take it you can go to blazes!" said Snorky
wrathfully. "But before you climb on your
high horse, suppose you restore my red choker
tie, my agate cuff buttons, my silver-rimmed
fountain pen and a few pairs of fancy socks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> is unworthy of even you," said Skippy,
who rose and with a perfect social manner took
the articles in question from the bureau on the
south side of the room and gingerly placed them
on the bureau in the western corner. "The
socks are in the wash. I prefer to return them
as I received them." After which he disrobed
and, somewhat consoled, watched from the
coverlets the indignant and bewildered Snorky
Green sitting on his bedside, halfway out of his
trousers, glaring at him in rage.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For a week, a miserable, lonely week, Skippy
held to this irreconcilable attitude. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this time he touched the bottom of depression&mdash;he
even doubted himself! Would he ever invent
anything again? Had it been just a flash
in the pan? Was it all a false start? What had
become of the imagination which had blazed up
so brilliantly? Perhaps after all he was no
different from the rest&mdash;just an average mind
fit only for such vulgar things as banking and
trade. Then one morning through the gloom
clouds a sudden shaft of sunlight arrived. He
had another idea!</p>

<p>He had been lolling deliciously in bed, disdaining
to notice the first harsh summons to
rise, and his mind had dwelt enviously on the
brilliant figure of Doc Macnooder. After all,
even Doc Macnooder had his failures. There
was the matter of the Folding Toothbrush,
which all Macnooder's eloquence had failed to
market with Bill Appleby.</p>

<p>"Jingo! That certainly was a bum idea," he
said to himself, somewhat comforted. "You
might do something with a toothbrush, but a
folding one is a joke!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>All at once he sprang out of bed and, reaching
the washstand in a bound, seized the nearest
tooth mug. Snorky, who, despite the present
unpleasantness, still trusted his rising instincts,
catapulted out of bed and arrived three
seconds later at his side of the washstand,
where through still foggy eyes he beheld Skippy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
gazing at a toothbrush which he held reverently
before him as a jeweler examines a named
stone.</p>

<p>"What the deuce?"</p>

<p>"Dinged if I haven't got Macnooder beat
a mile!" exclaimed Skippy, who in the first exhilaration
of discovery had completely forgotten
the correspondence acquaintanceship he
had imposed.</p>

<p>"It's about a toothbrush!" said Snorky with
great intelligence.</p>

<p>"You bet it's about a toothbrush." But here
Skippy suddenly remembered, and the smile
gave place to a frown.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Skippy! Let's call it off," said
Snorky in a rush of feeling. "It was dead
rotten of me and I'm doggone sorry&mdash;honest,
I am&mdash;but you've rubbed it in enough."</p>

<p>"Very well, I forgive you and I shall try to
forget," said Skippy, who also had chafed
under the long silence.</p>

<p>"What's the great idea?" said Snorky hurriedly.</p>

<p>"The great idea is a <i>Souvenir</i> Toothbrush,"
said Skippy proudly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The idea did not reach Snorky immediately,
but he was too diplomatic to show his disappointment,
so he said humbly:</p>

<p>"I suppose it's because I'm a dumb-head,
but why a souvenir toothbrush?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why a souvenir pillow-case? Why a souvenir
buttonhook or a souvenir bootjack or a
footstool, necktie, lap robe, or anything souvenir?"</p>

<p>"All right, why?" said Snorky, who felt hurt
at this assumption of intellectual superiority.</p>

<p>"The bootjack doesn't make the souvenir;
it's the souvenir makes the bootjack, doesn't
it?" said Skippy, who was thinking deeply.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Snorky had never heard of the Socratian
method, but he was impressed; so not understanding,
he nodded and answered:</p>

<p>"Aha, I see!"</p>

<p>"It's the thing you souvenir that's important.
If you want to remember you can't
remember too often."</p>

<p>"No-o."</p>

<p>"And how can you remember better than the
first crack out of bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I get all that," said Snorky, acknowledging
the brilliancy of the argument. "But how the
dickens can you make a souvenir out of a toothbrush?"</p>

<p>"My boy&mdash;my boy!" said Skippy with
crushing contempt. "Have you no imagination?
A souvenir toothbrush! Why, easy!
Make the handle in the shape of a baseball bat
and put the Lawrenceville-Andover score on
the back&mdash;red and black."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggswiggered!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can make 'em in the form of a riding
crop for racing sports, masts for yachtsmen,
sword-blades for the army. Why, it's a cinch!
You can have Lawrenceville shields on the
back, Princeton colors, Yale colors. You can
do anything, anything with the idea&mdash;you can
have your best girl's initials, or you can have
her photograph stenciled on!"</p>

<p>"Sure thing! Why not Mother or Auntie&mdash;'when
this you see remember to use me!'" said
Snorky, who feared where another flight of the
imagination might transport his roommate.</p>

<p>"Green!" said Skippy, flaring up at this
destructive levity; but before he could deliver
his broadside the breakfast gong began to rock
the house and simultaneously each head ducked
into a waiting basin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When Skippy during the relaxation of the
morning recitations considered the Souvenir
Toothbrush he was not so favorably impressed.
Snorky's suggestion somehow threw a touch of
ridicule over the whole proposition and Skippy,
like all true imaginations, shrank from ridicule.
Undoubtedly if the Souvenir Toothbrush became
a fact, mothers and governesses <i>would</i> abuse its
opportunities. Think of a parental eye gazing
admonishingly at you from the back of a toothbrush
every morning! Why, the name of Bedelle
might become an execration! He saw
himself pilloried among the oppressors of boykind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as unpopular as the compiler of a Latin
grammar or the accursed Euclid! No, the idea
was unthinkable! Skippy did not reject the
Souvenir Toothbrush <i>in toto</i>. He bought a
blank book on which he inscribed:</p>

<div class='center'>
INVENTIONS<br />
<span class="smcap">John C. Bedelle</span><br />
1896<br />
</div>

<p>On the first page under the day of the month
he wrote a full description, adding:</p>

<div class='center'>FIELD LIMITED<br />
<i>Suggestion&mdash;Hold until later date and patent anonymously.</i></div>

<p>Skippy then reluctantly admitted the destructive
force of Snorky Green's criticism of
the Souvenir Toothbrush; he admitted it, but
he could not forgive him for being right. There
are certain things which one does not forgive
a brother, a sister, or the chum of chums.</p>

<p>After all, was Snorky Green worthy of that
privileged and exalted position? A disturbing
doubt began to creep into Skippy's imagination.
He passed over the treachery in the
matter of the now defunct Bedelle Foot Regulator;
that might conceivably have been the
fault of an inferior temperament. It was the
spirit of negative criticism, the settled habit
of turning into raillery the fragile first impulses
of his inventive imagination, that was
alarming.</p>

<p>"Gee! If every time I get a big idea, he's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
going to knock it in the head, what's the use
of having an imagination?" he said gloomily.</p>

<p>After all, could a creative temperament yoke
itself to a destructive criticism without self-immolation?
Immersed in these brooding forebodings,
he came heavily up the Dickinson
stairs to the communal room. Suddenly he
stopped, amazed.</p>

<p>"What the deuce!"</p>

<p>On his bureau a flaming bit of color greeted
him from the somber mass of his pendent
neckties. He advanced and recognized Snorky
Green's red choker tie, which was particularly
dear to his young sartorial fancy. On the pin
cushion lay the agate cuff buttons and the
silver-rimmed fountain pen. He opened the
top drawer and beheld three pair of open-work
socks, red, orange and glowing green.</p>

<p>"Gee, how crude!" he said indignantly.</p>

<p>At another moment and in another mood his
heart might have softened at this evident peace-offering;
but this afternoon, with the new child
of his imagination slain by Snorky Green's
brutal wit, the whole proceeding was undeniably
crude, a bribe too openly offered. He would
have to return them; that was inevitable and
that was of course the last thing he wished to
do. He sat down at his desk, scowling horribly,
and then, moved by a fitting inspiration, he
seized his pen and dashed off the most frigid
and properly insulting of notes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>

</div>

<p>The last he considered such a master stroke
that, his good humor restored by the anticipation
of the infuriating effect on his beloved
friend, he began to whistle a triumphant strain.
He made a neat package, pinned the ultimatum
on it, and proceeded to the opposite bureau.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be teetotally jiggswiggered," he
said, astounded.</p>

<p>In the oval of the glass, a new photograph
had appeared in the company of the three other
smiling feminine beauties which Snorky Green,
as a man of the world, displayed by implied
right of conquest. Skippy set down his package
and craned forward for a closer examination.</p>

<p>"Huh! Old enough to be his grandmother,"
he said contemptuously, staring at the new
victim of Snorky Green's charms.</p>

<p>But at this moment, hearing a familiar step
in the hall, he bounded back in time to assume
a nonchalant, bored attitude as Snorky came
joyfully in, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Hello, old sporting life! What do you know
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Green," said Skippy, drawing himself up
and extending an elocutionary finger towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the bureau, "you will find something to interest
you there."</p>

<p>He waited a moment outside in the hall until
Snorky's bursting imprecation brought the
needed consolation, and then tripped down the
steps, seeking a calming jigger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Snorky as a Lady-killer</span></h3>


<div class='cap'><i>L'AMOUR a des raisons que la raison connait
pas</i>," say the French, who ought to know,
and the first expansive sentimental affection of
a boy for a chum has also its illogical quality.
Now, Skippy adored Snorky and the affection
was returned. He felt that Snorky would die
for him, as of course he would lay down his
own life for his friend, if they should ever
hunt together in African jungles. He was willing
to share Snorky's last dime, keep his confidences,
and fight shoulder to shoulder. He
admired, he respected, he loved Snorky, but
for the life of him he could not see wherein
Snorky Green's peculiar brand of beauty should
appeal to the young feminine eye any more
than his own lank frame and sharpened features.
Why should Snorky's glass present four
lovely and adoring feminine faces, while his
own should give back only a pointed nose
around which the orange freckles swarmed like
flies? True, the lady-killer's wardrobe was of
a magnificence which outshone his, but then
socks and neckties and cuff-button jewelry are
communal possessions.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Why should Snorky Green then inspire such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
passions while he passed lonely and unloved?
No, certainly Snorky was not beautiful. He
had a smudgy, stubby little nose. He was lop-eared
and the dank yellow hair fell about his
puffy eyes in straight, unrippling shocks. Yet
four women (three blondes and a brunette)
watched with affectionate glances the progress
of his casual morning toilette. Why?</p>

<p>The next morning, as Skippy reluctantly rose
and gazed upon the feminine galaxy waiting at
the bureau that was not his, the sense of his own
inferiority again smote him. Envy is the corrupting
cancer of friendship. He did like
Snorky. He yearned for the life-and-death devotion
of a chum of chums; a sort of Damon
and Pythias, D'Artagnan and Athos affair&mdash;but,
while this sense of inferiority continued,
the shadow was over the fair sunlit landscape
of impulsive friendship. It was so, and the feeling
would not down.</p>

<p>That evening, being alone, he stood again
contemplating the evidence of Snorky Green's
predatory progress among the ladies. He examined
the four photographs carefully.</p>

<p>"They can't all be sisters," he said gloomily;
besides, he knew that his roommate, more fortunate
than he, had to bear but one such cross.
"Danged if I can see what gets them. If that
fellow's a lady charmer, I'll hire out for a
matin&eacute;e idol!"</p>

<p>On the pin cushion was a pin in the shape of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
an arrow (an arrow of course suggested a
transpierced heart), which Snorky wore for
important ceremonies, when he donned a perpendicular
collar and a white coaching tie. On
the wall was a Farmington banner and on the
sofa five pillows worked by loving feminine
hands.</p>

<p>"Sisters never go to that trouble," said
Skippy, secure in his knowledge of sister nature.
"By the great horned spoon this can't
go on. I've either got to lick the stuffin's out
of him or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without finishing his phrase, he went to the
table, drew forth C&aelig;sar's "Gallic Wars," and
a copy of "Lorna Doone" and immediately
began to concentrate. A moment later Snorky
Green arrived chuckling from a foray down the
hall where he had just deposited a moth ball in
the lamp chimney of Beckstein, the Midnight
Poler. He came in rollicking and triumphant,
slamming and locking the door against a
sudden reprisal. Then, seeing Skippy, he
stiffened, scowled, and assumed an air of
frigid dignity. Skippy, with his eye on a convenient
mirror, followed his movements expectantly.</p>

<p>Snorky, having glared sufficiently at the unresponsive
back of his roommate, planted himself
in front of him and said angrily:</p>

<p>"Say, what in tarnation is biting you, anyhow?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Part of the pleasure which Skippy derived
from his periodic application of ostracism was
in the immediate success it achieved on his
roommate's impressionable temperament. At
present, being in an exceedingly grouchy mood,
he drew forth a pad and pencil and tendered
them with a plain intimation that only thus
would he receive any communications.</p>

<p>"What are you sore about?" said Snorky,
flaring up at once. "Just because I took a
crack at your old Souvenir Toothbrush? Is
that it?"</p>

<p>Skippy drew forth a handy literal translation
and ostensibly began to apply it to the baffling
text.</p>

<p>"My lord, you act like a sick girl! You're
a pleasant roommate, you are! How long are
you going to sulk like this?"</p>

<p>Skippy began to whistle softly to himself:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"You can't play in my backyard;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I don't love you any more."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Whereupon Snorky, having slammed a book
on the table, advanced with doubled fists, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You stop that, do you hear! You stop that
or&mdash;or&mdash;I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>Skippy, whose calm was delightfully reinforced
by this show of temper, again, but without
looking up, indicated the pad and pencil.</p>

<p>"I can lick you!" said Snorky hoarsely.</p>

<p>This was too much. Skippy sprang up, fists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ready, and glowered his defiance. For a long
moment they held this bellicose attitude, a
collision imminent. But a resort to primitive
methods is a serious affair between roommates.
Each hesitated, seeking a dignified evasion of
the crisis.</p>

<p>"Well, go on with your baby act, if you enjoy
it," said Snorky scornfully. "Lord, I'd hate
to have your disposition!"</p>

<p>The status quo having been restored, Skippy
discarded C&aelig;sar's "Gallic Perplexities" and
returned to boyhood's first heroine, while
Snorky in a rage retreated to his side of the
room and pondered.</p>

<p>"I certainly riled him that time," said Skippy
joyfully to himself. "Wonder what he'll do
now?"</p>

<p>After a few moments Snorky began to
whistle, meditating to himself, which in boyhood
is always a signal that the imagination is
working.</p>

<p>"What's the big idea now?" said Skippy,
following from the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>Snorky rose briskly and, repairing to his
closet, disappeared on all fours. A moment
later he returned, with a box of large and juicy
chocolate &eacute;clairs and a bottle of ginger pop,
and, establishing himself at the opposite end
of the table, began to enjoy himself audibly.</p>

<p>"The low-down hound!" said Skippy, writhing
on his seat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In his calculations, he had completely forgotten
the purchase of the afternoon. In turn
he rose, delved into the d&eacute;bris of his closet and,
returning, spread before his end of the table
one tin of deviled turkey (Snorky's favorite),
a large piece of American cheese and a bottle
of root beer.</p>

<p>It had now become a battle of wits, with each
resolved to impress the other with the delicious
satisfaction that he was experiencing and each
gazing from time to time at a point directly
above the other's head. There were six &eacute;clairs.
Snorky ate four rapidly, licking his fingers with
gusto after each.</p>

<p>Then he ate the fifth &eacute;clair more slowly and
with some effort. Despite all his self-control
Skippy's gaze could not turn from that last-surviving
member of the chocolate family. He
was suffering tortures, but suffering under a
calm and smiling exterior.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Snorky suddenly, talking to
himself. "I almost forgot."</p>

<p>He rose and left the room to Skippy and the
sixth &eacute;clair. Tantalus, amid his parched seeking
of a cooling draught, never suffered more
anguish than Skippy sitting there before that
undefended &eacute;clair, with only a gesture intervening.</p>

<p>"Of all the mean, dirty, contemptible tricks!"
he said angrily between his teeth, revolting at
this most treacherous trap. For he must not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he could not, no matter what the pain he must
endure, admit defeat by falling on that &eacute;clair.
He rose and went to the window. Certainly he
had been mistaken in Snorky; no one who would
carry a quarrel to such fiendish lengths had the
largeness of spirit that he had the right to demand
in a chum.</p>

<p>When Snorky returned, he glanced in some
surprise at the untouched &eacute;clair. Then he lifted
it gingerly, examined it closely to see if it contained
any foreign corrupting matter, and, his
appetite restored by the lapse of time, ate it
with smacking relish.</p>

<p>Skippy, crouched in his chair, ground his
teeth and tried to shut out the tantalizing
sounds. Snorky began to hum gaily to himself.
Then, proceeding across the direct line of his
roommate's vision, he took up the latest photograph
and contemplated it with a little exaggerated
rapture. It was the last straw.
Skippy's rage burst forth in a loud and insulting
guffaw.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Snorky, to whom the advantage of the situation
was now apparent, took up each photograph
in turn and smiled with the pardonable
pride of one who knows his own worth.</p>

<p>The next moment two books went flying
across the room, and Skippy, now thoroughly
infuriated, stood before him, arms akimbo, a
sneer on his disgusted lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't let me stop you. Go on, kiss it, fondle
it. Put it under your pillow and hug it, you
great big mooncalf! Say, why do you come to
Lawrenceville, anyhow? Why don't you go to
Ogontz or Dobbs Ferry?"</p>

<p>Then Snorky, tasting the sweets of revenge,
went to the table and, picking up the pad and
pencil, presented them to Skippy with a mocking
bow.</p>

<p>Skippy's reply is not to be found even in the
most up-to-date dictionaries. Furious at his
roommate, the world in general, and himself
most of all, he shed his clothes and dived into
bed.</p>

<p>"Girls&mdash;faugh!" he exclaimed in disgust
And, pulling the covers over his head, he retired
to his own ruminations.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Love Lightly Considered</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TO understand what Skippy felt one must
have known the springs of boyhood's impulse
towards perfect manhood.</div>

<p>To Skippy a man was that completed being,
who wore trousers that never bagged at the
knees, neckties that never slipped below the
collar button, who displayed a gold watch-chain
across a fancy vest, from whose lower lip a
cigarette was pendent, who possessed a latchkey
and the right to read far into the night, and
who shaved once a day. The sentimental complications
had escaped him. Whatever attracted
man to the frizzled, giggling, smirking,
smiling bipeds in shirts remained a mystery to
Skippy.</p>

<p>All at once he had to face this problem. He
had gone resolutely up the steps towards perfect
manhood. He had learned the art of pressing
trousers to a thin razor-edge from Snorky,
who was a year his senior in boarding-school
knowledge.</p>

<p>The necktie question was not yet settled,
though every morning he subjected his throat
to a strangle-hold.</p>

<p>He had bought a razor and twice a week,
trembling and apprehensive, drew it across his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
maidenly cheek. He slashed himself fearfully
but he did not mind that. He wore his scars
proudly, a warning to all that adolescence was
on him, as the young Heidelberg student flaunts
his wounds.</p>

<p>The cigarette (known as the Demon Cigarette,
the Filthy Weed, and the Coffin Nail)
had been a dreadful struggle. But he had won
out.</p>

<p>He loathed the Demon Cigarette as he abhorred
tobacco in any form, but he had martyrized
himself until he was able to puff up the
cold-air flue in the stilly reaches of the night
without having to grope his way back to the
bed and watch the room careen about him. He
did not inhale, but he had learned to imitate the
process so as to defy detection, as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Gee! It's good to fill the old lungs, isn't
it?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>These things, by dint of concentration and
courage, Skippy had achieved, not to stand
ashamed in the eyes of his roommate. And,
having with pain and perseverance traveled
this far, he suddenly, this night, realized how
much was still lacking.</p>

<p>Yes, there was certainly something lacking
in his progress towards perfect manhood, something
that Snorky had and he had not.</p>

<p>It was all very well to be a man, to smoke, to
shave, and to have acquired the sartorial evidence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
This was all very well&mdash;but others
must perceive it, too! This was the point. As
Snorky had done, he must do.</p>

<p>The new world to conquer was the feminine
heart.</p>

<p>Now, Skippy had not at this moment the
slightest inclination towards the lovelier sex.</p>

<p>He did not aspire to be a Don Juan or a Beau
Brummel, but if he were to continue to room
with Snorky Green he must acquire at least the
appearance. He perceived this. It pained him
that in the scheme of things it should be so&mdash;but
a reputation he must have.</p>

<p>"Girls, girls! Lord, how I loathe them!"
he said in a last farewell to his male independence.
"What I think of a fellow who
hangs around them, wears their rings and pins
and carries off their handkerchiefs! But I'll
be danged if I can stand any more of this conquering-hero
stuff from that eyesore across the
room! If it's got to be done, you bet I'll do it!
I'll put it over that four-flusher, if I have to
fuss every girl in Scranton!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Demon of Jealousy</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Easter vacation was ended and four
hundred overfed, underslept boys had returned
to spread the germs of measles, mumps
and tonsilitis among their fellows. Skippy and
Snorky, having fallen hilariously into each
other's arms, were proceeding with the important
ceremony of the unpacking, while surveying
each other with a critical eye.</div>

<p>"Seems to me you look quite spruced up,"
said Snorky when, to be more at his ease,
Skippy had shed his coat and stood revealed
in all the splendor of a flaming-yellow buckskin
vest, with gleaming brass buttons; then
noting the display of jewelry in the red and
yellow tie, he added: "Where did you get the
fancy stuff?"</p>

<p>Skippy removed his scarf-pin and gazed languidly
at the delicate garland of forget-me-nots.
Then he yawned and said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about her some day."</p>

<p>Snorky sat down on his best derby. "My
aunt's cat's pants! Have I lived to see it?"</p>

<p>"See what?" said Skippy loftily.</p>

<p>"You a fusser! Skippy Bedelle wearing a
girl's pin! Fan me quick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just because I haven't boasted about my
conquests&mdash;" said Skippy, and he brought
forth a little bundle carefully wrapped in a
green <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bandanna'">bandana</ins> handkerchief.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Snorky faintly.</p>

<p>From beneath the protecting folds of the
handkerchief appeared a white satin frame
with hand-painted violets rampant. Out of the
violets gazed an adoring pair of eyes.</p>

<p>"Is that her?" said Snorky.</p>

<p>"Lord, no! This is only Margot," said
Skippy, who inhaled the fragrance and offered
the same opportunity to his chum. "Rather
delicate, eh, what?"</p>

<p>"Smells like patchouli," said Snorky, beginning
to recover.</p>

<p>"Patchouli? Margot? Say, what kind of
females do you play around with? My girls
drive their own four-in-hands and wear pearls
for breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, ex-cuse me!" said Snorky with a mocking
courtesy.</p>

<p>Skippy brought forth a second photograph
and placed it on the bureau, and then a third.
Snorky, who had begun to sulk, feigned indifference
and proceeded to range <i>his</i> trophies on
the bureau.</p>

<p>"This'll cheer up the window seat a bit,"
said Skippy in the same casual tone.</p>

<p>Snorky's head appeared above the trunk long
enough to watch Skippy with his arms full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
pillows, lace and sweet-scented, scatter them
with a nonchalant gesture. But when, continuing
his man&oelig;uvres, Skippy in the new revelation
produced three banners emblazoned with the
insignia of feminine schools, Snorky capitulated
to his curiosity and, advancing to the
bureau, stood in open-mouthed wonder.</p>

<p>"I'll be jiggswiggered! Holy cats and Aunt
Jemima! I never would have believed it!"</p>

<p>Skippy brought out a fan, spread it, and
pinned it affectionately above the photograph
gallery.</p>

<p>"I guess that'll hold him," he said to himself.
"Poor old Snorky! I hope his heart is
strong enough."</p>

<p>"Been doing quite a bit of fussing yourself,"
said Snorky with a new respect. "Why didn't
you ever tell a fellow?"</p>

<p>"I never discuss women," said Skippy, dusting
off the fourth photograph.</p>

<p>"You must have gone the pace," said Snorky
in wonder.</p>

<p>"Oh, I looked them over quite a bit."</p>

<p>"But, my lord, Skippy! You can't have
loved all of them!"</p>

<p>"Just collecting souvenirs."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As a crowning touch, a climax long imagined,
plotted and hilariously enjoyed in prospect, he
next produced, before the bewildered eyes of
Snorky Green, what in school-day parlance is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
known as a Trophy of Trophies; an incredible,
amazing, inexplicable thing, a tasseled, beribboned,
pink and white bed cap! Snorky made
a feeble gesture or two and then lay down to
signify that the shock had killed him.</p>

<p>"Skippy! What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"This also is a thing I cannot discuss," said
Skippy, whose fondest imaginings were outdone
by reality.</p>

<p>"Any more?" said Snorky, struggling weakly
upward.</p>

<p>"That's all," said Skippy, who was gazing
contentedly at the imposing collection. But
all at once he reflected: "Hello, where in the
deuce did I put her?"</p>

<p>He pretended to search through his trunk
and valise in great concern until, Snorky's curiosity
having been properly awakened, he suddenly
struck his forehead.</p>

<p>"Of course. How silly of me!"</p>

<p>And diving into his inner pocket he brought
forth a last tribute, encased in neat pink morocco,
which he arranged in the unmistakable
position of honor.</p>

<p>Snorky approached on tenterhooks. The
next moment he burst out: "Mimi!"</p>

<p>"What, you know her!" said Skippy, surprised
in turn. "Rather cute little thing."</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>On Snorky's bureau in the same place of
honor was an identical photograph, a little Japanese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
brunette, with a descending puff and an
ascending nose. They stood staring at each
other, and the temperature of the room seemed
to recede towards the freezing point.</p>

<p>"When did you meet her? How long have
you known her, and how the deuce did you
get her photo?" said Snorky, with blazing
eyes.</p>

<p>Skippy was in a quandary. A false step
might tumble about him the glorious fabric of
his new reputation. He went to his bureau and
thoughtfully considered the pink morocco case
stolen from his sister's collection. Revenge
had been sweet, yet the impulse was still on
him. He decided that a quick conquest would
be the more galling to a rival's pride.</p>

<p>"Oh, we waltzed about a bit, but I gave her
an awful rush."</p>

<p>Snorky went and sat down in a corner, elbows
on his knees, his chin in his hands. Seeing thus
the wreck he had caused, Skippy began to be
troubled by his conscience. Suppose it really
was a serious affair. Wouldn't it be nobler to
surrender the fictitious conquest to his beloved
friend, to adopt a sacrificial attitude and allow
Snorky to go in and win her?</p>

<p>"I say, old boy, I'm awfully sorry; do you
really care?"</p>

<p>"For Mimi Lafontaine? For a girl that
can't tell a man from a cabbage? Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>All kindly feelings vanished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the good of calling yourself
names?" said Skippy crushingly. He picked
up the photograph and smiled at it. "Mimi is
a flirt, but she has her good points."</p>

<p>"Look here!" said Snorky, rising in sudden
fury. "There's one question has got to be
answered right now."</p>

<p>"And pray what is that?" said Skippy, resting
one elbow on the top of the bed and crossing
his legs to show his perfect calm.</p>

<p>Snorky planted himself before the bureau
and extended his hand in a furious gesture
towards the lace bed cap that now adorned the
top.</p>

<p>"Does or does not <i>that</i> belong to Miss Lafontaine?"</p>

<p>"Any one who would lower himself to ask
such a question," said Skippy, still in a stage
attitude, "does not deserve my sympathy. I
would have given her up. Now I shall keep
her."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think she cares for you, you
chump?"</p>

<p>"I do not discuss women."</p>

<p>The gauntlet had been thrown down and the
demon of jealousy took up his abode with
the <i>m&eacute;nage</i> Bedelle and Green. For a week the
comedy continued, while conversation was reduced
to a minimum and transmitted in writing
along the lines of Skippy's imagining. Each
watched the other's correspondence with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
jealous eye. Whenever Skippy received a letter
from home, he ostensibly hugged it to his
shirt-front and, repairing to a corner, read it
furtively with the pink morocco case before
him. Afterward he would execute a double
shuffle across the room, whistle a hilarious
strain, and give every facial contortion which
could express a lover's joy, while Snorky
squirmed and scowled and pretended not to
notice. Snorky in turn retaliated by writing
long letters after hours by the light of a single
candle, ruffling up his hair and breathing audibly.
In the morning Skippy, passing towards
the washstand, would see on the table a swollen
envelope, addressed:</p>

<div class='center'>
Miss Mimi Lafontaine,<br />
Farmington,<br />
Conn.<br />
</div>

<p>These letters troubled him. When a fellow
could write over four pages it certainly must
be serious, and these looked as though they
held forty. The trouble was that Skippy had
begun to believe in his own passion. The little
Japanese brunette had become a reality to him.
He had talked with her, walked with her, received
the avowal of her own uncontrollable
impulse towards him. In fact, at times he almost
believed that he had actually held her in
his arms and whirled in the dizzy intoxication
of the waltzes he had announced. He even was
able to feel a real pang of jealousy, a fierce and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
contending antagonism against Snorky, who
actually knew her. Such a situation was of
course fraught with too many explosive possibilities
to long endure. Fortunately Fate
stepped in and preserved the friendship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">All's Well That Ends Well</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>A &nbsp; WEEK after these events, returning on a
Saturday morning from the last vexations
of the curriculum with the expectant thrill of
the opening of the baseball season, Skippy was
amazed to receive, by the hands of Klondike,
the colored sweep, a scribbled note in the
familiar handwriting of his sister:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dear Jack:</span>

<p>Miss Green and I and a party of girls are down for the
game. We're at the Lodge. Come right over and bring
Arthur.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Sis.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>His first emotion was one of horror; had they
been up to the room, and was his duplicity
forever at the mercy of a sister's gibes? Klondike
reassured him. He bounded upstairs,
made a hasty survey, found everything in order,
and hastily departed for the Lodge, after a
quick plunge into the glorious buckskin vest, a
struggle into a clean collar and a hurried dusting
off of his shoes against the window seat.
He reached the parlors of the Lodge on the
heels of Snorky Green, who, being as thoroughly
bored by the prospect as he, forgot the
week's feud in a common misery.</p>

<p>"Gee! Aren't sisters the limit?"</p>

<p>"Well, we're in for it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's hope they clear out before dinner."</p>

<p>The next moment Skippy was perfunctorily
pecking at the cheek of Miss Clara Bedelle
and pretending to be overjoyed at the
prospect of parading before the assembled
school with six young ladies in tow. Then he
looked up and something like a cataleptic fit
went through his body.</p>

<p>Directly in front of him, evidently waiting for
the introduction, was unmistakably Miss Mimi
Lafontaine! He looked at Snorky and saw the
same expression of horror over his pudgy
features, as he came up, knees shaking, to be
introduced in turn.</p>

<p>Then to Snorky's distressed soul came the
welcome sound:</p>

<p>"Jack, dear, I want you to meet Mimi&mdash;Miss
Lafontaine."</p>

<p>To the amazement of sisters and friends,
said Snorky, advancing with outstretched hand:</p>

<p>"Hello, you old Skippy!"</p>

<p>Skippy clung to it as to a spar in midstream.</p>

<p>"Snorky, old dear&mdash;it's all right."</p>

<p>"It is?"</p>

<p>"You bet it is!"</p>

<p>"What are you idiotic boys doing?" said
Sister Green.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell?" asked Snorky roguishly.</p>

<p>"Women have no sense of humor," said
Skippy, grinning with a great easement of the
soul.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment they rose above the vexations
of the female intrusion. They looked at
each other and each comprehended the other.
They were equals, equal in imagination, in
audacity and expedient. This mutual revelation
cleared away all past misunderstanding
and jealousies. The sense of humor was triumphant.
They loved each other.</p>

<p>A half-hour later, having, to the utter amazement
of sister No. 1 and sister No. 2, rolled
hilariously, arms locked, across the campus,
they lay on opposite beds, struggling weakly
to master the pangs of laughter which smote
them like the colic.</p>

<p>"Are we going to tell our real names?" said
Skippy at last.</p>

<p>"Let's."</p>

<p>"You know, Bo, you certainly had me going&mdash;you
certainly did. And all these months,
too! Snorky, I bow before you."</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Snorky admiringly.</p>

<p>"Say! You're all right, but honest now,"
said Skippy, pointing to Snorky's bureau and
the feminine galaxy, "honest, who are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course one's my sister," said
Snorky, grinning. "I swiped these three and
I bought the other with the frame. Say, I'm
not worried about how you got yours, but what
I'd like to know is, who in tarnation belongs
to that boudoir cap?"</p>

<p>"My grandmother, and she's a corker, too!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>They clasped hands and Snorky announced
solemnly:</p>

<p>"Skippy, old fellow, let 'em have all their
old skirts; there's nothing like the real thing,
the man-to-man stuff, is there?"</p>

<p>"You bet there isn't."</p>

<p>"And say, I'm sorry about that souvenir
toothbrush, honest I am, and I think you're a
wonder, I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right. That's all right,"
said Skippy, embarrassed. "There's a lot of
money in it, but I guess I prefer to make my
pile in other ways."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Woman Of The World</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>NOW that the Snorky-Skippy friendship had
been placed on the firm rock of mutual revelation
and all unfounded jealousies swept
away by frank confession, Skippy's imagination
returned to the real purpose of life. He
was a little ashamed of the time wasted on the
opposite sex, even if for a worthy purpose.
Such frailties were all very well for Shrimp
Davis and the Triumphant Egghead, who had
legs educated for the ballroom, but he, John C.
Bedelle, had other missions to perform in this
life which held such short years for a man of
imagination.</div>

<p>For several days he sought diligently among
the needs of human nature for something on
the grand scale. He tried his hand at a perpetual-motion
machine. He thought out a combination
submarine and airship which would
put the navies of the world at the mercy of his
country. He even descended to such trivial
abstractions as a Reversible Shirt-Front, which
took its due place in the book of inventions
under the following entry:</p>

<div class='center'>REVERSIBLE SHIRT-FRONT</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Argument: Admitted that Reversible Shirt-Fronts
are easy to manufacture; what demand would there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be for them? Could they be popularized among the
working classes? Treat cuffs same way.</p></div>

<p>For certain reasons he decided not to discuss
this last invention with Snorky Green. These
tentative efforts were but exercising his imagination.
He knew it and waited breathlessly.</p>

<p>But at last, a month after the failure of
the Foot-Regulator, the long-awaited thrill arrived,
the thrill which comes only with the possession
of a Universal Idea, and for the first
time in his long, untroubled fifteen years, it
arrived in conjunction with the intrusion into
his still simple scheme of things of that arch-disturber&mdash;<span class="smcap">woman</span>.</p>

<p>Miss Virginia Dabtree was not destined to
occupy the proud place of the first love, though
Miss Dabtree (who was Snorky Green's aunt)
was eminently equipped for such a position,
being eighteen years his senior and at an age
when by instinct, habit, and a need of self-encouragement,
any tribute from the opposite
sex, no matter how given, caused her not the
slightest irritation.</p>

<p>Skippy, however, was too completely dazzled
by the consummate artistry of Miss Dabtree's
clinging toilettes, the built-up luxuriousness of
her hair, the pink and white complexion, the
stenciled eyebrows, and the Lady Vere de Vere
attitudes to dare to entertain a personal hope.</p>

<p>He was dazzled, dumfounded! A new world
opened to him. Through her at last he perceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
woman, her place in the now more complex
scheme of things, the influence she could
exert, the stimulus to the imagination, and the
answer to his need of some guiding purpose.</p>

<p>True, Miss Dabtree's age was her protection.
She was removed from even the flights of his
imagination, yet the influence she exerted all
unwittingly over his life was inestimable. For
it was for her, to protect her, that he, Skippy
Bedelle, conceived his magnum opus, the Mosquito-Proof
Socks.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The hour was eight, the day Sunday, the time
the first clear week in June. They sat together
on the porch of the Kennedy, listening to the
sound of the Upper House singing rising
clearly above the twang of banjos across the
campus from the esplanade.</p>

<p>The long twilight had set in, yet the afterglow
hung brilliantly about them. Skippy was
balanced gingerly on the front edge of a rocker
which swayed perilously under him and added
to his general discomfort. There was a safe
straight-backed stationary chair only ten feet
away, but to save his life he could think of no
legitimate excuse for rising and possessing it.
If he leaned back the sharp upright collar, borrowed
from Dennis de Brian de Boru Finnegan,
cut cruelly into his chin, and when he craned
forward the red choker tie (restored by Snorky
in addition to the agate cuff buttons) bulged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
forth in the most disconcerting and unimpressive
luxuriance.</p>

<p>"You've known Snorky, that is, Arthur, a
long time, haven't you?" he said desperately,
breathing hard.</p>

<p>"Why, you funny boy! I'm his aunt," said
Miss Dabtree, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" He felt he had offended her
mortally, so to repair his social blunder he said
point-blank: "Gee! Some fellows are born
lucky!"</p>

<p>"Now that is sweet of you," she said, giving
him the full effect of her heavenly smile. "But
I'm afraid you're a terrible flatterer."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell her about the Foot Regulator?"
thought Skippy, who felt the need of confiding
his life's ambition.</p>

<p>But at this moment Destiny arrived in the
shape of a mosquito that registered its coming
on one of Skippy's open-work socks. Skippy
shook his foot uneasily, just enough to disturb
the intruder but not enough to attract Miss Dabtree's
attention. The mosquito transferred its
operations to the other sock. Skippy, in order
to conceal his predicament, slowly crossed his
legs and then hastily uncrossed them, not being
quite sure of the etiquette of such a position.</p>

<p>The mosquito, pursuing its way, lighted
on the graceful silver-sheened stocking which
Skippy had been contemplating furtively for
the last ten minutes with a sudden realization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that the feminine ankle has certain strange sentimental
values utterly different from those for
which his and Snorky Green's were created.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/facing-078.jpg" width="283" height="400" alt="&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Miss Dabtree with an impetuous lunge towards the point of attack. Page 78" title="&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Miss Dabtree with an impetuous lunge towards the point of attack. Page 78" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Good gracious!&quot; cried Miss Dabtree with an impetuous lunge towards the point of attack. Page 78</span>
</div>

<p>But immediately a terrible dilemma arose.
How was he to act? In another moment the
beautiful creature so perfumingly close to him
would notice the intruder, might even retreat
before the menace of more mosquitoes, and the
rapturous twilight opportunity for opening his
confidence would pass forever. His instinct
was all to protect her. But how? To slap at
the insect with his cap or his hand was unthinkable.
He found himself blushing at the very
thought! Yet how to warn her without acknowledging
that his attention had been concentrated
on the lower graceful silhouette? He
might offend her irreparably. Even if he exclaimed,
"Look out, there's a 'skeeter,'" what
would he answer if she in her innocence should
ask, "Where?"</p>

<p>As he debated this, hot and cold, the inevitable
happened.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Miss Dabtree with
an impetuous lunge towards the point of attack,
which made Skippy modestly avert his gaze.
"This place is filled with mosquitoes. We never
can sit here!"</p>

<p>She rose and led the way to the parlor.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and wait for Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks awfully; much obliged,"
said Skippy, gulping down his disappointment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
He tripped against the foot-scraper and made
a mess of opening the door for her. He wanted
above all things in the world to follow her in
and be permitted just for a few more wonderful
minutes to sit and gaze at her loveliness. But
to admit this was impossible. Whatever happened,
she must never suspect, never! So at
loss for an excuse he stammered, "I'd love to,
but really I ought to get back for study hour."</p>

<p>A moment later, having backed and scraped
down the steps and thanked her profusely for
some indefinite thing for which she ought to be
thanked, he went rushing around the corner,
let himself in by King Lentz's window, and surreptitiously
gained his room. At last, having
torn off the red choker tie and freed his neck,
back once more to the ease of bachelor attire, he
returned wrathfully to the pest which had perhaps
saved him from his first sentimental excursion.</p>

<p>Sunk in a cushioned armchair, his slippered
feet on the desk, a bottle of cooling ginger pop
in one hand and a cream puff in the other, he
placed before his imagination the problem:</p>

<p>"Why the mosquito?"</p>

<p>The more he pondered the more he became
impressed with the fact that here indubitably
was one of the errors of the Almighty. Snakes
destroyed rats and mice at least, but what
earthly purpose was served by mosquitoes?</p>

<p>He knew, as all smatterings of outer information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
reached him via the weekly lecture course,
that besides being a stinging annoyance to the
human race, the mosquito was a breeder of
plagues and had to be fought in southern climes.
Having wrathfully considered his subject and
come to the conclusion that no mitigating circumstances
could exist, he next put to himself
this problem:</p>

<p>"If the mosquito cannot be exterminated,
can it be neutralized? If so, how?"</p>

<p>When Snorky Green, to whom Miss Dabtree
was more aunt than woman, came bursting in
an hour later, with the rebellious consciousness
of having thoroughly earned the five-dollar bill
which lay in the safest of pockets, he stopped
short at the sight of his roommate in that reclining
concentration which Sherlock Holmes
has popularized, the briar pipe being replaced
by a large pencil, on which Skippy was chewing
in heavy meditation.</p>

<p>"I say, Skippy, the old girl certainly came up
handsome!" said Snorky gleefully, searching
for the bill.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;sh!" said Skippy without turning.</p>

<p>"What the deuce?"</p>

<p>"I want to think."</p>

<p>"Danged if he isn't inventing something
else!" said Snorky, who went on tiptoe to a
position where he could study the frowning
outward signs of the mental disturbances which
were undoubtedly working inwardly. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
end of a silent hour, Skippy condescended to
relax.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Snorky excitedly.</p>

<p>Skippy rose with dignity and went to the
window, gazing out a moment into the darkling
night where unknown myriads of mosquitoes
lurked all unconscious of the doom impending
over them.</p>

<p>"I say, Skippy, what's the big idea?"</p>

<p>"It's big&mdash;bigger than anything you ever
imagined," said Skippy impressively.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to tell a fellow!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>Now Snorky was not without a certain knowledge
of human nature, particularly Skippy-nature,
so without further interest he proceeded
to disrobe, flipping the five-dollar bill on the
table with a rakish gesture and saying carelessly:</p>

<p>"The old gal has a heart, anyhow. However,
ta-ta for the night."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Skippy spoke from the
depths of his bed.</p>

<p>"Snorky, I'll tell you this much."</p>

<p>There was a convulsion among the opposite
sheets and Snorky sat up.</p>

<p>"Go on, I'm listening!"</p>

<p>"It's bigger than bathtubs."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"Snorky, it's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's mosquitoes!"</p>

<p>Accustomed as Snorky had become to the
young inventor's cryptic methods, his imagination
refused to follow.</p>

<p>"You don't see?"</p>

<p>"How the deuce should I see?"</p>

<p>"Snorky, I'm going to put the mosquito out
of business!"</p>

<p>"How in tarnation!"</p>

<p>"When I get through with him," said Skippy
loftily, "when my plans are perfected&mdash;he'll
starve to death!"</p>

<p>"Oh, say! Skippy, is that all you're going
to tell me?"</p>

<p>"That is all for to-night," said Skippy, who,
seizing a slipper, flung it across the room at the
evening's candle after the methods introduced
by the lamented Hickey Hicks, and plunged the
room into darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Plot Against the Mosquito</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>IF close association had brought to Snorky a
canny knowledge of his roommate's need of
unbosoming himself of a great idea, it had also
acquainted Skippy with the profit to be derived
from Snorky's overwhelming curiosity, particularly
when there were any symptoms of ready
cash.</div>

<p>The next afternoon, therefore, without being
unduly surprised, he accepted an invitation to
accompany Mr. Snorky Green to the home of
the Conovers up the road, where the record
for pancakes at one continuous sitting stood
at forty-nine to the honor (without challengers)
of the Hon. Hungry Smeed.</p>

<p>Somewhere between the fourteenth and fifteenth
pancake, having solicitously offered the
maple syrup, Snorky said casually:</p>

<p>"That's a jim-dandy idea of yours, old
horse, about mosquitoes."</p>

<p>"I'm looking at it from all sides."</p>

<p>This answer did not satisfy Snorky Green's
thirst for information, so he said encouragingly:</p>

<p>"It's a great idea. You must."</p>

<p>"Heard of Luther Burbank and what he does
with plants?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, that was in last week's lecture. Seedless
fruit and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Snorky," said Skippy meditatively, "who
knows but some day a scientist will cross the
mosquito with a butterfly?"</p>

<p>"What good'll that do?"</p>

<p>"It would take the sting out of the mosquito,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose it put it into the butterfly."</p>

<p>"If you're going to be facetious&mdash;" said
Skippy, who, being sufficiently fed, rose with
dignity, glad of the opportunity to postpone
the discussion to another appetizing sitting.</p>

<p>For a week Snorky Green, greatly impressed
by the concentrated moodiness of his chum's
attitude, artfully fed him with pancakes, &eacute;clairs,
Turkish paste, and late at night tempted him
with deviled chicken and saltines to be washed
down with ginger pop and root beer.</p>

<p>Skippy, having calculated nicely the possibilities
of the exchequer, threw out progressively
dark, mysterious hints that fed Snorky's curiosity,
without any open gift of his confidence.
Even Doc Macnooder, aware by all outward
signs that the imagination which had conceived
of the Foot Regulator was again fermenting,
had laid his arm about his shoulders and led
him to the Jigger Shop.</p>

<p>But the Skippy Bedelle, who had assumed
the trials and tribulations of manhood, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
profited by the first disillusionments. The
trusting, childlike faith was gone forever and
in his new, skeptical attitude towards human
nature&mdash;Toots Cortrelle excepted&mdash;he had
determined to part with as few millions as
possible.</p>

<p>"I say, Skippy, how's it working out?" said
Snorky at eleven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, producing the crackers
and cheese, after having blinded the windows
and hung a blanket over the telltale cracks of
the door.</p>

<p>"Fine!"</p>

<p>"Is that all you're going to tell me?" said
Snorky with his hand on the cheese.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but soon," said Skippy, whose
appetite always betrayed his caution.</p>

<p>"In that case I serve notice right here I'm
through with the financing!"</p>

<p>"The financing!"</p>

<p>"What else do you call it?" said Snorky
indignantly, producing the last two quarters
from his pocket, and restoring the cheese to its
box.</p>

<p>"All that will go down to your credit
account," said Skippy in a conciliatory tone.
"I'll tell you this much. There's nothing in
the butterfly idea&mdash;it would take too long."</p>

<p>"Huh! You didn't think I bit on that!
Well, how're you going to clean 'em up? They
destroy 'em in Cuba with kerosene&mdash;I've
been reading up. Is it something like that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Destroy them, why destroy them?" said
Skippy reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"If you destroy mosquitoes you destroy your
income, you poor boob," said Skippy with his
superior manner. "Let 'em live&mdash;who profits?
I do."</p>

<p>Snorky rose and produced the Bible.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said, in a fever of excitement.
"I'm ready. Give me the oath."</p>

<p>"You'll take the oath on my own terms!"
said Skippy, looking at him fixedly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, terms?"</p>

<p>"Snorky, it's so big it may take years of
investigation, you understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"This time I'm not giving up any fifty-one
per cent."</p>

<p>"Let her go!"</p>

<p>"And if any one goes in they go in on a
salary!"</p>

<p>"Oho! I see."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll swear," said Snorky, after a
brief wrestling between his curiosity and his
financial instincts.</p>

<p>"It may be years working out," said Skippy
sadly. "Maybe our children will live to see it;
but Snorky, some day, I'm telling you, when
the idea is perfected, the mosquito is going to
starve to death!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Snorky, without waiting to be prompted,
hurriedly took an oath to guard the secret from
man woman and child and called down the
scourges of Jehovah on his nearest of kin if
he should ever prove false.</p>

<p>"Snorky," said Skippy, folding his arms behind
him and spreading his legs after the manner
ascribed to the famous Corsican, "where
do mosquitoes bite you the most?"</p>

<p>"Golly! Where don't they?" said Snorky,
who, thus reminded, began to scratch back of
his ears.</p>

<p>"Where do they bite where you can't hear
them coming?"</p>

<p>"Legs and ankles," said Snorky instantly.</p>

<p>"Bright boy&mdash;you're getting closer."</p>

<p>"Danged if I can see it."</p>

<p>"Protect the ankles and the mosquito starves&mdash;am
I right?"</p>

<p>"Hurry up," said Snorky, who by this time
recognized that the first reasoning processes
were simply eliminatory.</p>

<p>"That was my problem," said Skippy, frowning
impressively. "Here is the answer&mdash;this
is how it came to me." He went to the bureau
and passed his hand into a sock, two fingers
projecting through the devastated regions.
"What do you call this?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that's my sock."</p>

<p>"You call 'em hole-proof socks," said Skippy,
ignoring the aspersion. "You get it? You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
don't? Suppose we change it, suppose we use
the same organization but call it&mdash;Mosquito-Proof
Socks."</p>

<p>"Mosquito-Proof Socks!" said Snorky in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Skippy, satisfied at the staggering effect produced,
stood with a smile waiting for the full
result.</p>

<p>"But, Skippy, is it&mdash;possible?" said Snorky
faintly when he had brought his lower jaw back
under control.</p>

<p>"That's not the way to look at it," said
Skippy impatiently. "Is the idea A No. 1, or
is it not?"</p>

<p>"The idea? My aunt's cat's pants&mdash;the
idea!" said Snorky all in a breath, "Mosquito-Proof
Socks! Why, it's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;" But
here Snorky stopped, nonplussed, having exhausted
his supply of adjectives on the Foot
Regulator.</p>

<p>"It is!" said Skippy firmly.</p>

<p>"But won't they be too heavy?"</p>

<p>"What the deuce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, they'd have to be regular bullet-proof,
wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"Say! What do you think I'm talking about&mdash;Tin
Socks?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen! This is the way you get at it," said
Skippy, walking up and down in ponderous
concentration but pausing from time to time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dip into the cheese. "You begin by looking at
it from the point of view of the mosquito. A
mosquito has got nerves, hasn't he, just like a
horse or a cat or a bullfrog?"</p>

<p>"Sure he has."</p>

<p>"What frightens a mosquito most?"</p>

<p>"Is it a joke?" said Snorky <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thoughfully'">thoughtfully</ins>.</p>

<p>"Green&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I apologize," said Snorky hastily, and he
brought out a bottle of sarsaparilla.</p>

<p>"A horse shies at a bit of paper; a sneeze
will scare a cat, won't it? Well, then, what will
scare a mosquito&mdash;it's all there!"</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>will</i> scare a mosquito?" said
Snorky, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"That is the field of investigation," said
Skippy in a melancholy voice.</p>

<p>"But you said Mosquito-Proof Socks!"</p>

<p>"I did. Suppose a harsh sound annoys a
mosquito; all you've got to do is to suspend
a tiny rusty bell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't like that," said Snorky instantly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound modest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is probably not the way," said Skippy,
dismissing this objection with a wave of his
hand. "I'm thorough, that's all. Supposing
there are certain colors that scare him or make
him seasick&mdash;red and purple or yellow and
violet."</p>

<p>"By jingo! Now you're talking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose the mosquito has some deadly enemy.
Then all you've got to do is to work his
picture into the design of the socks."</p>

<p>"Holy cats!"</p>

<p>"Supposin' it's just the sense of smell you
get him by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Citronella!" fairly shouted Snorky.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Skippy, alarmed at the outbreak.</p>

<p>"Citronella!" said Snorky in a whisper.</p>

<p>"You see? Mosquito-Proof Socks is the
idea&mdash;and there must be fifty ways of working
it out."</p>

<p>"Cheese it!" said Snorky, dousing the light
at a sound in the hall.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At a point somewhere between the witching
hour and the dawn Snorky said in a tentative
whisper:</p>

<p>"Hey there, Skippy! Are you awake?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Gosh! Skippy, I can't sleep. It's just
steaming around in my brain!"</p>

<p>"M. P. S.?"</p>

<p>"You bet. I can't see anything but them,
millions of them!"</p>

<p>"Mosquitoes?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;legs! Holy Jemima! Skippy, have
you thought how many legs there are in the
world? Why, in the United States alone twice
ninety-two million. Think of it! And what'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they average in socks and stockings? I've been
trying to work it out all night. Gee! My head's
just cracking. If you multiply twice ninety-two
million by seven pair of socks or even
six&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Skippy angrily, and he
thought to himself, "Thinking of money, thinking
of money! How mercenary he is!"</p>

<p>"Standard Oil is nowhere," said Snorky
feverishly.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it!"</p>

<p>"Oil'll run out but there'll always be
mosquitoes and legs!"</p>

<p>"Darn you, Snorky! Shut up and let me
sleep!"</p>

<p>But how was he to sleep with the vision that
Snorky's avaricious imagination held out to
him? All night long he tossed about restlessly,
wandering in a forest of legs; white ones and
red ones, black ones and yellow ones, tall ones
and short ones, fat, thin, bow-legged and
crooked, all the legs in the world waiting for
him to rise up and protect them!</p>

<p>The next morning it was worse. All his imagination,
suddenly diverted from the exact
scientific contemplation, was halted before the
stupendous contemplation of future profits.</p>

<p>"Snorky Green is a bad influence," he said
moodily as he trudged out heavy-headed from
morning chapel. Do what he might, the contamination
spread. With all the long fatigue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of patient investigation he knew was ahead, his
mind leaped over the present and galloped into
the future.</p>

<p>"Multiply twice ninety-two million legs by
six pair of socks," he found himself repeating.
"Oil may run out, but you bet there'll always
be mosquitoes and legs."</p>

<p>Yes, it was greater than Standard Oil. It was
fabulous to conceive of the wealth that would
be his. All at once the John C. Bedelle Gymnasium
seemed ludicrously inadequate. He would
double the present equipment! There would
be a second campus&mdash;Bedelle Circle! The
school lacked water; he would create a lake for
it and the John C. Bedelle Boathouse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Bedelle, kindly shine for us. You may
translate, John, but be cautious and not too
free."</p>

<p>The Roman's mocking voice brought him precipitately
to his feet. He opened his book but
the passage had escaped him and though he dug
Shrimp Bedient savagely in the back, no signal
returned.</p>

<p>"Excellent so far, quite exceptionally excellent;
nothing to criticize," said the Roman's
rising and falling inflection. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I didn't do the advance."</p>

<p>The class roared and the Roman said:</p>

<p>"Too bad, John, too bad! No luck in guessing
this morning. We're in the review, John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Too bad! Dreaming again, John? Don't do it,
don't do it! The country will take care of itself,
without you. Times are hard, John. Another
year in the Second Form is a dreadful drain on
Father's pocket-book. Sit down, John, and
don't dream&mdash;don't do it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Skippy sat down and glared at the Roman.</p>

<p>Some day, some day he would even institute
a fund for superannuated teachers, he would!
He would come back some day to the school he
had made the greatest in the country; he would
come as the <span class="smcap">benefactor</span> and then the Roman,
old, and decrepit in a wheeled chair, would be
brought to him, to him, John C. Bedelle, whom
as a boy he had held up to the ridicule of the
class! What a revenge that would be, the proud
and haughty Roman, the greatest flunker of
them all, the Roman of the caustic tongue and
the all-seeing eye, actually clinging to his hand,
stammering out his thanks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Roman
whose mocking voice still echoed in his memory,
"Don't dream, John, don't do it!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Tennessee Shad Suspects</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Tennessee Shad, as has been told, was
long, thin and full of bones. His imagination
was chiefly occupied in initiating ideas
which would be the cause of exertion in others.
In the warmth of the budding season he came
out of his winter cage and could be seen for
long hours perched on his window sill in the
Kennedy, legs pendent; like some dreamy vulture,
surveying the horizon for a significant
point.</div>

<p>There was little that escaped the Shad.
For some time his curiosity had been stirred
by the unusual attentions paid to Skippy Bedelle
by his old side-partner, Doc Macnooder.
Doc was eminently practical and if Doc devoted
any part of his time to an inconsequential
underformer, in the language of the day, there
was something doing.</p>

<p>The early visits of Macnooder to Skippy's
room at the time of the Foot Regulator campaign
had been noted, likewise the subsequent
cooling of the affection. So when after a few
weeks' lapse Macnooder was again seen impelling
Skippy in the direction of the Jigger Shop
with a protecting arm over his shoulders, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Tennessee Shad whistled softly through his
teeth and said to himself:</p>

<p>"I wonder what new flim-flam game is on?"</p>

<p>Now Macnooder was distinctly a trespasser,
for Macnooder belonged to the Dickinson and
Skippy was of the Kennedy and, by that token,
his lawful prize. The Tennessee Shad's vigilance
redoubled. He began to note the air of
mystery and solemnity which hung over the
two roommates, their frequent whisperings and
the moments of intense excitement when, with
locked arms and heads close together, they
drew surreptitiously away from their fellows
for secret conclave. When presently Greaser
Tunxton, a solitary youngster who ranked high
among the polers and high markers with a curious
penchant for chemistry, began to be seen
in their company, the Tennessee Shad's vigilance
became acute.</p>

<p>One night, when after hours he was returning
from a midnight spread in King Lentz's room,
his ear detected unmistakable signs of activity
behind Skippy's door across the hall. A quarter
of an hour later two stocking-clad forms
stole past his open door and slowly down the
treacherous stairs. The Tennessee Shad followed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Below, the door of Greaser Tunxton opened
cautiously and as cautiously closed again. A
moment later the Shad, now at the keyhole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
heard the window open and the sounds of a
foray into the night. He calculated nicely,
passed into the room and out the window and
took up the trail of the three shadows moving
in the general direction of Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Tennessee Shad, having
stalked his prey in classic Deerslayer manner,
reached the farther stretches of the pond and,
flat on his stomach among the high grasses,
heard the following mysterious dialogue:</p>

<p>"How's this, Skippy?"</p>

<p>"Fine! Must be millions of them."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they sleep?"</p>

<p>"We'll wake 'em up."</p>

<p>"Shucks! It's only bullfrogs," thought the
Tennessee Shad; but at this moment perceiving
the three in clear silhouette against the faint
moonlight, he instantly discarded that explanation.
The three wanderers into the night were
clothed in helmets, from which voluminous
folds of cheesecloth descended to the waists,
while each had his trousers rolled up well above
the knees. The conversation continued, to his
growing mystification.</p>

<p>"They're awake, all right. I can hear them
coming!"</p>

<p>"You're the boss, Skippy. What's the
order?"</p>

<p>"Twenty paces apart. Greaser, you shake
the bell, slowly. Snorky, you stand here, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mind you, no slapping or moving. Everything
scientific."</p>

<p>"All right, but get a move on. Ouch, I've
got two already."</p>

<p>"Red leg or blue leg?"</p>

<p>"Blue, darn it!"</p>

<p>"Fine! I'll count a hundred slowly. Start
up, Greaser."</p>

<p>The low, harsh, grating sounds of a rusty
bell slowly agitated began to be heard, punctuating
the droning count: "Five, six, seven!"</p>

<p>"For the love of Willie Keeler, what is it!"
said the Shad, more and more bewildered, as
he rubbed one leg against the other and shook
his head to protect himself from the many insects.
"It must be a secret society and this is
the initiation."</p>

<p>"Skippy?"</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>"The bell's no good at all."</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine, thirty&mdash;remember your oath."</p>

<p>"Say! Count a little faster; I can't hold out
much longer."</p>

<p>"Red leg or blue?"</p>

<p>"Both, darn it!"</p>

<p>"Any difference?"</p>

<p>The reply was too blasphemous to be set
down here.</p>

<p>The Tennessee Shad, too, was paying dearly
the price of his curiosity; so, being convinced
that he had stumbled upon a secret initiation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he decided to get some enjoyment out of the
situation. Presently, trumpeting his mouth
with his hands, he emitted a long, wailing
sound:</p>

<p>"Ugh, wugh, guggle, guggle!"</p>

<p>"Good lord! What was that?"</p>

<p>"Did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"It's a night owl that's all; fifty-six, fifty-seven&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oonah, woonah, WOO, HOO!"</p>

<p>"Night owls nothing; it's ghosts!"</p>

<p>"There ain't no ghosts, you chicken-livered&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this moment the Tennessee Shad,
smarting from head to foot, let out an ear-splitting
screech and the three experimenters
in mosquitology disappeared at top speed. The
Tennessee Shad, satisfied, emerged, examined
with curiosity a discarded helmet smeared with
citronella-soaked cheesecloth, and picked up a
rusty dinner bell. This last stuck in the crop of
his imagination.</p>

<p>"Secret-society stuff," he said to himself as
he slapped his way out of the marsh. "But
why the bell? Darn mysterious, that bell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments in Fragrance</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE result of the first investigation in the
likes and dislikes of the New Jersey mosquito
brought a decided difference of opinion. It
was admitted (given the swollen condition of
Greaser Tunxton's legs) that the insect's sense
of hearing was undoubtedly defective. Snorky
Green was equally emphatic in expressing his
conviction that all colors were alike to it, but
Skippy insisted that it was not scientific to
jump to a conclusion on the basis of one experiment.</div>

<p>"But golly! I had forty-seven bites on the
red stocking and sixty-five on the blue, and if
that doesn't prove anything, I'd like to know
what!"</p>

<p>"It proves that blue attracts them more than
red, that's all. We must now try other combinations."</p>

<p>"It proves one thing right here," said
Snorky Green, dousing his legs with the second
bottle of witch hazel. "I'm through on the
human-experiment game, and that's flat."</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to believe we should concentrate
on the sense of smell," said Skippy
thoughtfully. "As a matter of fact the experiment
turned out as I foresaw."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"It did, eh?" said Snorky wrathfully.</p>

<p>Skippy retreated to the other side of the
table and hurriedly announced:</p>

<p>"I've been talking it over with Greaser here
and the problem is narrowing down. Now what
we've got to figure out is, shall we make it a
washing solution or something that'll stick forever?"</p>

<p>"Washing solution."</p>

<p>"Sure we could wash the socks in some sort
of preparation of citronella, couldn't we?"</p>

<p>"That's too easy. Any one could do that."</p>

<p>"Exactly! That's why we must experiment
further. Greaser's got some very good ideas."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, bring on your stinks; I can
stand them."</p>

<p>"You can?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"You swear?"</p>

<p>"I swear. What's the idea, Greaser?"</p>

<p>Greaser Tunxton looked at him hard and
thoughtfully before replying.</p>

<p>"You see, citronella comes out in the wash,
but there are one or two other things much
stronger."</p>

<p>"Citronella's pretty strong!" said Snorky,
who began to wonder if he had promised too
rashly.</p>

<p>"Ever heard of asaf&oelig;tida?" said Skippy,
with his hand on the chemical genius.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff you put on the furnace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
at co-ed schools when you want a cut," said
Snorky, who knew the story of Dink Stover's
reasons for coming to Lawrenceville.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible," said Greaser in his
smileless, scientific manner, "that, properly
treated, a mixture of silk and cotton, possibly
wool, will retain enough of the essential quality
of asaf&oelig;tida for at least a dozen washings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Isn't citronella bad enough?" said Snorky,
with a horrible misgiving.</p>

<p>"It's extremely doubtful," said Greaser,
shaking his head, "but I don't want to say anything
definitely before we make exhaustive experiments."</p>

<p>"Where?" said Snorky, shrinking. "If it's
down at the pond again, good night!"</p>

<p>"Green!" said Skippy wrathfully.</p>

<p>"Bedelle to you!"</p>

<p>"The experiments can be conducted right
here," said Greaser reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, why didn't you say so?" said
Snorky, feeling a little ashamed. "Perhaps
after all asa&mdash;asa&mdash;well, whatever it is, will
come out in the wash, too."</p>

<p>"If it does," said Greaser proudly, "I've
got something worse."</p>

<p>"Worse!" said Snorky, with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"<i>Worse!</i>" said Skippy joyfully.</p>

<p>"If you put that on," said Greaser, meditating,
"the socks will be better than mosquito-proof&mdash;even
rattlesnakes wouldn't bite you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Criminy! What is it?"</p>

<p>"I know what it is," said Greaser, wagging
his head wisely, "but I can't pronounce it!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Events now moved rapidly. The following
morning, despite the draft which entered
through three windows and swept out the door,
the Roman stopped the morning recitation
after five minutes of indignant commotion in
the class and, making a detailed investigation,
dispensed with the presence of Mr. Snorky
Green, Mr. Skippy Bedelle and Mr. Greaser
Tunxton (the last with incredulous chagrin)
with a request to produce each individual bath
record for the week.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock that night Snorky Green
deserted the communal laboratory, bag and
baggage, announcing that he was through once
and for all, and sought asylum of Dennis de
Brian de Boru. Finnegan, after the first whiff,
barricaded the door and seized a baseball bat
to repel any aggression via the transom.</p>

<p>At eight-thirty, the inhabitants of the second
floor held an indignation meeting on the steps.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! What is it?" said the Triumphant
Egghead, smelling in the direction of the
offending room.</p>

<p>"It's a dead cat."</p>

<p>"Smells like ripe sauerkraut and garlic!"</p>

<p>"No, it smells like asaf&oelig;tida."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"The deuce you say! Asaf&oelig;tida is a maiden's
perfume to this!"</p>

<p>"Well, some one's dead."</p>

<p>"It's the Greaser, then."</p>

<p>"My Lord! This is awful!"</p>

<p>"Skippy's found a pet skunk."</p>

<p>"How in blazes are we going to stand it?"</p>

<p>"We won't."</p>

<p>When the odor had finally rolled down the
stairs a house meeting was called and the offenders
were summoned to appear. Skippy Bedelle
and Greaser Tunxton responded and the
house adjourned through the windows. Now it
happened that the Roman was dining in Princeton
that night and the conduct of discipline
was in the hands of a young assistant master,
lately transferred from the wilds of the Dickinson,
Mr. Lorenzo Blackstone Tapping.</p>

<p>Tabby, as he was more affectionately known,
was apt to be somewhat confused, as is natural,
before an extraordinary crisis, and had made
one or two lamentable blunders. In the present
case, after immediately sending in a hurry call
for the plumber, he departed in a panic for
Foundation House, holding before him on a pair
of tongs a pair of reeking football stockings
which he had seized in the wash basin, while
Skippy Bedelle, under strict orders, remained
twenty paces to the rear and out of the wind.</p>

<p>Arrived before the dark and awesome, ivy-hidden
portals of the Head Master's dread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
abode, Mr. Tapping carefully deposited the
unspeakable mess against the stone steps, stationed
the rebellious Skippy under an opposite
tree and entered, in a fever of excitement.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" said the Doctor, starting
from his chair. "Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it's not myself. That is, it's&mdash;it's
the whole house; it's young Bedelle, sir.
The fact is, Doctor, the situation was so serious
that I&mdash;I thought I'd best come to you
directly, sir."</p>

<p>"Try to give the details a little more calmly
and coherently, Mr. Tapping," said the Doctor,
retreating behind a handkerchief and studying
the young assistant with a growing suspicion.
He indicated his guest and added, "Professor
Rootmeyer of Princeton&mdash;Mr. Tapping, one
of our younger masters."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Skippy, shivering under
the apple tree, beheld Tabby reappear, take up
the tongs gingerly and return to the house.
Almost immediately the window of the Doctor's
study opened with a bang and there was an
iron clank in the near roadway.</p>

<p>"I never smelled such a smell! Is it possible?"
said the Doctor, coughing. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I don't know," said Mr. Tapping
miserably.</p>

<p>"You don't know and you are a B. S.?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what is your explanation, or have you
any explanation of this extraordinary occurrence?"</p>

<p>"I think, sir, the boy is completely unbalanced."</p>

<p>"Bedelle! He's always been steady and well
conducted."</p>

<p>"He's been acting queerly lately, sir, and he
absolutely refuses to give any explanation.
The house, sir, is quite untenantable. I&mdash;I
don't think the boys can sleep there to-night."</p>

<p>"Where is Bedelle now?"</p>

<p>"He is outside, sir&mdash;waiting."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better examine into this
myself," said the Doctor, frowning. "Bedelle
is a good boy&mdash;a bit of a dreamer, but a good,
reliable boy. Mr. Tapping, you may return to
the Kennedy and quiet them. I shall be over
later. Keep Bedelle waiting&mdash;outside."</p>

<p>"Jim," said Professor Rootmeyer, the distinguished
chemist, "there are only two things
in God's universe can produce a smell like that&mdash;a
dead Indian and butyl mercaptan."</p>

<p>The Doctor immediately discarded the first
hypothesis.</p>

<p>"Frank, you've hit it. It <i>is</i> butyl mercaptan,"
he said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you know?"</p>

<p>"I remember once when I was a shaver&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Professor Rootmeyer as the
Doctor came to a hurried stop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'm, we are living in the present," said the
Doctor after a second thought.</p>

<p>He rose and went to the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Bedelle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The stench began to swell with the hurried
approach.</p>

<p>"Stop there," said the Doctor hastily, and,
having had his imagination sharpened by frequent
contact with the genus boy, he added with
sudden inspiration: "Go round to my study
window. I will speak to you from inside."</p>

<p>A moment later Skippy's white face appeared,
framed against the night.</p>

<p>"Bedelle, Mr. Hopkins reports that you were
dismissed from first recital this morning, for
being in a condition which unfitted you for
association with your fellow beings. Is that
true?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, it was the citronella."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tapping reports that the stench arising
from your room has made the house untenantable.
Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, that was asaf&oelig;tida and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And butyl mercaptan; I'm quite aware of
that," said the Doctor quickly, to continue the
tradition of omniscience.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Bedelle, what is your explanation?
Were you trying to poison any one?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were not contemplating self-destruction,
were you?" said the Doctor, whose curiosity
led him to adopt a light coaxing manner.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, I was experimenting."</p>

<p>"Experimenting! What for?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, I can't tell you," said
Skippy defiantly. He had foreseen the test,
but he was resolved to be drawn and quartered
before yielding up the secret of his future millions.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;can't&mdash;tell&mdash;<span class="smcap">me</span>?" said the Doctor
in his pulpit sternness.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I've taken an oath."</p>

<p>"Do you realize, Bedelle, that you owe me an
explanation, that if there is no explanation
for this extraordinary attack on the discipline
and morale of the school that I should be quite
justified in requesting your immediate departure?"</p>

<p>"I know, sir. Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you refuse still?"</p>

<p>"It's an invention, sir. That's all I can tell
you, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Please, Doctor, I'd
like to stay in the school."</p>

<p>The Doctor considered. He was a just man
and his sense of humor allowed him to distinguish
between the vicious and the playful imagination.
After long, agonizing moments for
Skippy waiting at the window, he took a sudden
decision.</p>

<p>"Bedelle?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"If I let you remain at Lawrenceville, will
you give me a promise&mdash;that so long as you
remain here, you won't attempt to invent anything
else?"</p>

<p>"So long as I'm in the school?" said Skippy,
broken-hearted.</p>

<p>"Absolutely. It's that or expulsion. I have
four hundred tender lives to protect. Well?"</p>

<p>"I swear," said Skippy, with tears in his
eyes.</p>

<p>The Doctor bit hard and said:</p>

<p>"Then I shall overlook this. Your record is
in your favor. I shall overlook this. I have
your word of honor, Bedelle. Good night."</p>

<p>Skippy drew a long breath and went hurriedly
back to the Kennedy. But there he
halted. The smell was awful and the comments
which reached him through the open windows
were not at all reassuring.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I think perhaps it's warm enough
outside," he said, heavy-hearted.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>For two more years he had solemnly sworn
to refrain from inventing, and Skippy was a
man of his word. No matter, there was this
consolation: Mosquito-Proof Socks would some
day be a reality; butyl mercaptan had proved
its worth at the first test. He would devote
himself to a scientific preparation. He was
young. With twice ninety-two million legs to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
be protected with six pairs of socks or stockings
a year, he could afford to wait.</p>

<p>"Before I'm thirty, I'll be a millionaire," he
said defiantly. "I'll own race horses and yachts
and boxes at the opera and I'll marry&mdash;" Here
he hesitated and the figure of Lillian Russell
somehow became confused with a new apparition.
Something that was and was not
Miss Virginia Dabtree, but most certainly wore
silver stockings, which it would be his duty and
privilege to protect. "Well, anyhow, she'll
drive a four-in-hand and wear pearls for breakfast,"
he concluded, and, whistling, he went
down to dream out the night in the baseball
cage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Soap and Sentiment</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TEN days after the dreadful fiasco of the
Mosquito-Proof Socks, when a corps of experts
had succeeded in removing the stench
from the upper floors of the Kennedy; when
certain garments had been taken out under a
vigilantes committee and had been publicly interred;
when the three offenders had again
been permitted to resume their membership in
civilized society&mdash;Snorky Green began to be
alarmed at certain disquieting symptoms in the
conduct of Skippy Bedelle.</div>

<p>"I don't like it," he said, standing before
his roommate's washstand in a dark <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'revery'">reverie</ins>.
"Danged if I like the looks of things. Somethin'
is certainly doing. It certainly is."</p>

<p>He picked up a large new nailbrush, showed
it to Dennis de Brian de Boru, who had been
called in consultation, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Spending his money on bric-a-brac like that&mdash;and
that's not all!" he said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Let me know the worst," said Dennis who,
perched on the table tailor fashion, had been
ruminating, and when Dennis de Brian de Boru
remained silent, the mental wheels were grinding
rapidly. "Fire away, if you want to know
anything&mdash;ask me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Snorky proceeded to lift the broken cover
of the soap dish, and brought forth a cake
which he tendered gingerly to Dennis for his
olfactory inspection.</p>

<p>"What a lovely pink stink!" he exclaimed,
after one sniff. "Smells like the cook on her
Sunday off."</p>

<p>"Are you convinced?"</p>

<p>"I am. Skippy, the human scent-box is undoubtedly
in love. Object matrimony."</p>

<p>"He's got it bad this time," said Snorky,
remembering that they had a reputation as
lady-killers to maintain.</p>

<p>"If you will associate with 'em, it's bound to
happen," said Finnegan in his rapid fire style.
"I know the symptoms. My brother Pat went
maudlin, when he was just Skippy's age. Ten
years of it, presents Christmas and birthdays,
flowers twice a month, postage stamps and
letter paper, weekly bulletins and all that sort
of rot! Ten years, and then he married a girl,
best friend stuff, trust you together and all that&mdash;married
her a month after he met her. Think
of the expense. Not for me, old top&mdash;my
money goes for race horses."</p>

<p>"You've nothing to worry over, you wild
Irishman," said Snorky, who felt a certain presumption
in this lesson.</p>

<p>"Casting aspersions? Oh, I don't know! I
may not be beautiful, but women, proud women,
have sighed as I passed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Run away," said Snorky impatiently.</p>

<p>"I was just going," said Dennis with dignity.
At the door he paused for a parting shot.
"Hard luck, old gormandizer. There won't be
so many midnight spreads for you, now. Cut
down the jiggers, shut up the pantry, tighten
the belt! Skippy'll need his money for <i>other</i>
things. Thank the Lord the only thing he can
get into of mine, is a necktie. Hard luck!"</p>

<p>Perhaps a little of the practical reactions had
occurred to Snorky, for he flung a shoe at the
diminutive Finnegan and was still in a brown
study when Skippy came in.</p>

<p>"If he starts to wash he's in love. Bet
that's why he's been so friendly," he thought,
waiting developments. "I thought it was queer
he didn't sulk more after the big smell!"</p>

<p>In fact Snorky had been considerably puzzled
at his roommate's actions after the fiasco of the
Mosquito-Proof Socks.</p>

<p>"Any mail?" said Skippy nervously.</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Come to think about it, there might be a
letter over on the table."</p>

<p>The Byronic melancholy vanished from Skippy's
face. He sprang to the table and seized
the envelope.</p>

<p>"Feeling better?" said Snorky, noting the
beneficial results.</p>

<p>"Much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You look ten years younger."</p>

<p>"You go to blazes!" said Skippy, but without
anger. He went to the bed and flinging
back the mattress uncovered three pairs of
trousers slowly hardening into that razor edge
which is the <i>sine qua non</i> of a man of fashion.
Apparently satisfied, he next proceeded to the
mirror, where, after a short inspection, he
seized his brushes, dipped them into the water
pitcher and laboriously began to reconstruct
the perfect part that was beginning to replace
the Skippy cowlick. Trousers may be brought
to order in a few minutes, but to subdue a cowlick
is a matter of years. Ten minutes' rigorous
application of the brushes failing to
produce results, he ducked into the washbasin,
drove a line with the comb, slicked down the
sides and applied a press, in the form of a
derby, which process will subdue the most
recalcitrant of cowlicks for at least two
hours.</p>

<p>"Aha! Object matrimony?" said a squeaky
voice.</p>

<p>Skippy looked up wrathfully to perceive the
curious eyes of Dennis de Brian de Boru gazing
from the transom. Both brushes went flying
across the room, but Dennis knew when his
presence was <i>de trop</i>. The episode shook off
the derby and deranged the part. Snorky
watched the process of reconstruction with a
meditative glance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Skippy, old horse, you are <i>so</i> spick and
span. Has love really come to you?"</p>

<p>"You go take a run and jump," said Skippy
lightly and he began to whistle a genial air.</p>

<p>Now if Bedelle had denied the direct accusation,
Snorky would have been certain of its
truth, vice versa if the answer had been broadly
affirmative, Snorky would have at once dismissed
the suspicion. Skippy's light, <i>de haut
en bas</i> manner left him unconvinced. Circumstantial
evidence was all he had to go on, but
the evidence was strong. Skippy undeniably
was a changed man.</p>

<p>"What day is it?" said Skippy, who had been
reading over the letter.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, you chump."</p>

<p>"Three days to Saturday," said Skippy with
a sigh. He went to the washstand, poured out
the water and began to scrub diligently at his
nails.</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to get them clean by that
time," said Skippy facetiously.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"So you are in love?" said Snorky, shifting
the conversation.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, open your heart, what's a roommate
for?"</p>

<p>"You'd be a nice one to confide in! Why not
shout it in a telephone?"</p>

<p>"Hold up, that's a raw deal," said Snorky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
rising wrathfully. "I may have weakened
under that awful stink, but I kept the secret,
didn't I? Didn't I stand up three hours
against the whole blooming house and did they
ever get a word from me about Mosquito-Proof
Socks, and in the state of temper they were too?
Oh, I say, come now, square deal you know!"</p>

<p>Skippy considered him more favorably. Besides,
he remembered that by Saturday he
would need to embellish his sartorial display
with a few treasures from his chum's wardrobe.
He sat down and took his head in his hands.</p>

<p>"Snorky, old fellow, you're right&mdash;I've got
it bad."</p>

<p>"And you're going over to Princeton Saturday
to meet her?" said Skippy, who saw a trail.</p>

<p>"Her, what her?"</p>

<p>"Mimi Lafontaine, of course," said Snorky
with a sudden intuition.</p>

<p>"Her name is Tina," said Snorky tragically.
"Her first name. Perhaps some day I can tell
you her real name, not now."</p>

<p>"Rats, it is Mimi, and you're going over
again to meet her at the game," said Snorky,
who knew the Skippy imagination.</p>

<p>"So you think I'm going to Princeton," said
Skippy looking at him wisely. "I am&mdash;but
from there I am making a cut for New York.
Get the point?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tina's in New York?"</p>

<p>"She is." He hesitated a moment, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
weighing his words to give full value to their
dramatic significance, he added&mdash;"She is on
the stage."</p>

<p>"You're a thundering, whooping, common-a-garden
liar," said Snorky, who felt that his
sympathies were being trifled with. "Where in
blazes would you know an actress anyhow?"</p>

<p>"And you asked my confidence!" said Skippy
reproachfully. "Tina and I grew up together.
She ran away a year ago. It's a terrible story,
terrible! She's had the devil of a life, poor
little girl. Gosh, if I were only twenty-one!"</p>

<p>"Skippy, if you are faking it again this
time," said Snorky, whose confidence was
shaken by the perfect seriousness of his chum's
melancholy. "If you are, dinged if I'll ever
believe another word."</p>

<p>"See here&mdash;did I volunteer to tell you?"
said Skippy, who rose with a complete injured
air. "That settles it. This is all you'll ever
know."</p>

<p>And leaving Snorky in a ferment of curiosity
he went to his desk, drew out a sheet of paper
and began to run his fingers through his hair.</p>

<p>Snorky, as a matter of fact, had hit the nail
on the head, though of course it would never
do to have him suspect it. Skippy did not mind
confiding to him his state of mind, in fact it was
absolutely necessary if he were to go on without
an internal explosion to seek some sympathy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and understanding. But to admit to Snorky
that he had actually succumbed to Mimi the
Japanese brunette, particularly when the issue
was still clothed in doubt,&mdash;was unthinkable.
So Skippy invented Tina.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Love Comes Like the Measles</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>IT had all happened the Saturday before, when
for reasons of her own Miss Clara Bedelle
(the reasons taking shape in the heroic figure
of Turkey Reiter, captain of the eleven, and the
Triumphant Egghead, premier danseur of the
school) had asked Skippy to invite those
heroes, as she, being already wise in protective
knowledge, preferred not to show her affection
too directly. Skippy, on receipt of these sisterly
directions, had been in a towering rage,
for it had never occurred to him that men of the
world such as Turkey and the Egghead would
for a moment condescend. If it had not been
for the added bait of a Princeton game, he
would never have found the courage. The result
upset all his preconceived theories, and it
was not until he found himself on the high road
to Princeton, actually squeezed into a buggy
between two eager and enthusiastic lords of
the school that he attempted to reason it out.
The attempt, however, was beyond him. If
girls as such were incomprehensible, how the
deuce was he, Skippy Bedelle, to conceive that
such a thing as a sister, particularly his sister,
could arouse any enthusiasm?</div>

<p>"Guess it's the grub and the game all right,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he reflected finally. "Anyhow they will let me
alone, that's something."</p>

<p>At lunch it did seem that his wish was to be
gratified and despite certain sisterly glances of
reproach, he was able to secure a third helping
of roast beef and a double portion of ice cream
and cake, with the connivance of Miss Biggs
the chaperone, while Sister and Miss Lafontaine
attended to the chatter. So engrossed was he
in this attempt to stock up for the long week
ahead, that he completely failed to notice the
comedy which was being played to the greater
edification of Mr. Turkey Reiter and the obvious
disconcerting of the Triumphant Egghead, who
was being neglected flagrantly and openly for
mysterious reasons known only to the ladies.</p>

<p>Skippy, therefore, was totally unprepared, as
he was both shocked and terrified, suddenly to
find himself at the side of Miss Mimi, with
Turkey and his sister behind, while the Triumphant
Egghead, not to give his tormentor
any further satisfaction, was pretending to
laugh uproariously at something that his companion,
Miss Biggs, had just said. For five
minutes Skippy was in the most complete funk
of his life. His body seemed suddenly all hands
and pockets and do what he would his feet
would interfere as they had that awful day
eight months before when he had descended
into the family parlor in the first pair of long
trousers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think that Princeton is just the sweetest
place in the world, don't you?" said Miss Lafontaine
with the air of a great discovery.</p>

<p>"I'm preparing for Yale," said Skippy
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad," said the young lady immediately,
and sinking her voice to a confidential
whisper, she added, "you know I'm Yale
too though you mustn't give it away. I think
Yale men have such strong characters, don't
you? You can't help but admire them, can
you?"</p>

<p>Skippy had no ideas upon any subject whatsoever
at that moment, besides he hadn't the
slightest idea what she meant. So he took out
his handkerchief and then put it back suddenly,
as he remembered that a nose was never blown
in polite society. As Miss Lafontaine's sole
object in appropriating Skippy was the reflex
action on the Triumphant Egghead, it was absolutely
necessary that Skippy should at least
give the appearance of appreciating the privilege.
Miss Mimi, therefore, decided to jump
the fence of strict conventionality if the expression
be permitted.</p>

<p>"Jack," she said, coming closer, "own up
now, you are a terrible woman-hater, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Damn all sisters," he muttered to himself.
Then he looked up and met at the deadliest of
ranges, the smiling, mischievous eyes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Japanese brunette. Despite himself, he broke
into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Girls do give me a pain," he said abruptly,
"but for the love of Mike, I mean for heaven's
sake, don't tell Sis I said that."</p>

<p>Miss Mimi immediately passed her hand
through his arm.</p>

<p>"Won't you try very, very hard, Jack, to
make an exception?"</p>

<p>He breathed hard and something warm went
up his back like the warm ripple of the hot
water when his body slowly immersed. If
Snorky Green could see him now! Mimi hanging
on his arm, Mimi's soft voice pleading with
him, Mimi, just as she had done in the fictitious
weeks, throwing herself at him, actually throwing
herself at him! He tried to remember one
of the dozen eloquent replies he had once
evolved, but nothing came.</p>

<p>"I say, you're not a sister, are you?"</p>

<p>Miss Lafontaine was considerably puzzled
by this but pretended that she was an only
child.</p>

<p>"Well that makes a difference; I thought you
couldn't be," said Skippy unbending a little,
"you act differently."</p>

<p>"Oh I see," said Mimi, who had half expected
a display of sentiment, "aren't you a
funny man. So you don't approve of sisters?"</p>

<p>She had called him a man&mdash;perhaps after
all his sister had not told the age of his trousers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
He straightened up and answered, "Oh, I suppose
they are all right&mdash;later on."</p>

<p>"Jack&mdash;you <i>are</i> a woman-hater!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he said, beginning to be
flattered, and he fell to wondering how he could
call her Mimi, which of course was his right.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a secret, but perhaps you know
it already. Perhaps after all you are only making
fun of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Mimi," he said all in a gulp and
then blushed to his ears.</p>

<p>The young lady, noticing this, smiled to herself
and continued:</p>

<p>"Well, if you are simply pretending, it's a
very good way to get a lot of attention, but of
course you know that."</p>

<p>"I? What? Oh, really you don't think!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. Because of course that
is what does make a man interesting. It is
such a compliment when he does take notice.
Now a man like Mr. Sidell who jollies every girl
he meets&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Egghead is a terrible fusser," said
Skippy with new appreciation of his own value,
"you should have seen him at the Prom."</p>

<p>"Did he have Cora Lantier down, the blonde
girl with the big ears!"</p>

<p>"She was blonde but I didn't notice the ears.
She was down two weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, she was?"</p>

<p>Miss Lafontaine glanced backward and snuggled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a little closer. Skippy began to be aware
of the strangest of symptoms; at one moment he
felt a rush of blood to the forehead just like the
beginnings of bronchitis, the next moment his
throat was swollen as though it were the
mumps, yet immediately there came a weakness
in his knees that could only be influenza. The
warm contact of the little hand penetrated
through his sleeve, the sound of her voice shut
out all other sounds in his ears, and when he
met her eyes his glance turned hastily away
and as avidly returned.</p>

<p>Mimi Lafontaine at the age of nineteen knew
very little of the school curriculum, but had a
marked aptitude for the liberal intuitive arts.</p>

<p>"Mimi would flirt with a clothes horse, if
you flung a pair of trousers over it," a dear
friend had said of her, and on the present occasion
she was deriving a good deal of pleasure
from the situation. The attitude of a young
lady of nineteen, about to emerge into society,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vis-a-vis'">vis-&agrave;-vis</ins> with a youngster sprouting out of his
first long trousers, particularly when he happens
to be the brother of a best friend, is a
fairly obvious one. There is no excitement to
be derived but a certain amount of exercise. A
fisherman is necessarily a man who enjoys
catching fish, and if trout are not rising to the
fly, sitting on the edge of the wharf and hauling
in suckers is still fishing.</p>

<p>At the end of the afternoon Skippy was head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
over heels in love. If he had had the opportunity
he would have trusted her with the secret
of his life's ambition&mdash;the Bathtub and the
Mosquito-Proof Socks. But Miss Mimi was too
busy extracting information about the Triumphant
Egghead (who had countered by steadfastly
devoting himself to Miss Biggs) and
certain sentimental chapters in the past of her
best friend in which she had had a revisionary
interest. These <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'subleties'">subtleties</ins> naturally were beyond
the experience of Skippy, in fact he was
quite unable to reason on anything. His heart
was swollen to twice its natural size, his pulse
was racing, and the next moment with the
wrench of the farewell, he felt in a numb
despair, the light go out of the day, and a vast
sinking weight rushing him down into chill
regions of loneliness.</p>

<p>"Say Skippy, old sporting life," said Turkey
Reiter, speaking over his head to the Egghead,
who was in a terrific sulk, "How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Do what, Turk?"</p>

<p>"Why, my boy, you're the quickest worker
I ever saw; I thought the Egghead knew his
business, but he's a babe, a suckling to you!"</p>

<p>"Mimi Lafontaine is the damnedest little flirt
I ever met," said the Egghead, with a slash of
his whip which sent the buggy careening on two
wheels.</p>

<p>"Hold on there!" said Turkey, grabbing the
reins. "I've got to live another week. Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Skippy, my hat's off to you, old sporting life.
You've got her feeding out of your hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
Mimi too, right under the Egghead's eye!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come off now, Turkey," said Skippy,
to whom this light badinage was torture.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said the Egghead, "you know her
game."</p>

<p>"Well you played a pretty slick game yourself,
old horse, but how did you enjoy Miss
Biggs?"</p>

<p>"You go chase yourself," said the Egghead,
flinging the remnants of a cream puff at the
horse, which kept Turkey busy for the next five
minutes.</p>

<p>Skippy scarcely heard. All he wanted was
to have the drive over and to be alone with his
memories. How bold he had been at the end
when he had crushed her little hand in his!
Had she understood&mdash;and just what had she
meant when she had said,</p>

<p>"And so it's Jack and Mimi now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>That night at precisely 10.45 in his sixteenth
year, hanging out of the second story window
of the Kennedy, with a soul above mosquitoes,
Skippy Bedelle discovered the moon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Forty-eight hours later, Skippy suddenly
realized that the hot and cold symptoms, the
loss of appetite, the inability to concentrate his
mind on either "The Count of Monte Cristo"
or "Lorna Doone," the hardness of his bed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the length of the day were not due to either
German measles or the grippe. He was suffering
from something that neither Dr. Johnny's
pink pills, nor his white ones nor the big black
ones could alleviate. He was in love, genuinely,
utterly, hopelessly in love.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Urchin Begins to Bloom</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE first result of young love was a sudden
aversion to the well-known but freckled
features of Skippy Bedelle. The examination
in the looking-glass had left him in a condition
of abject despair. Only a man, full-fledged and
resplendent, could hope to hold the affections
of the dazzling Mimi Lafontaine, and what a
tousled, scrubby little urchin he was! That
night he spent one dollar and twenty cents, out
of a slender reserve, for toilette accessories,
and began the long fight for a part in the
middle of his reckless, foaming hair.</div>

<p>The next day marked a milestone in the sentimental
progression of Mr. John C. Bedelle. For
the first time in his life, his astonished eyes encountered
a little blue envelope inscribed to his
name in a large, dashing, unmistakably feminine
hand. Neither mother nor sister, aunt or
cousin had ever addressed that letter. He
picked it up and then set it down with a sudden
swimming feeling. It was postmarked
"Farmington."</p>

<p>"My Lord, if it should be from her," he said.</p>

<p>There was, of course, one sure way to solve
the difficulty, but Skippy was too overcome by
his emotion to imagine it. Instead, he sat down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and contemplated it with a mystical veneration.</p>

<p>"It can't be. No, no, it can't be from Mimi!
Good Lord, no. A girl doesn't write to a man
first," he said, shaking his head. "It's from
Sis. It's a joke, and she's got some one else
to address it. That's it."</p>

<p>He opened the letter, which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dear Jack,</span>

<p>I'm writing you for Clara, who is, as you know, a dreadfully
lazy person. School is over and I shall bring Clara back
to Trenton with me day after to-morrow. Are you so bored
with my dreadful sex or have you made a little exception?
Any way, this is to warn you that you may have to be my
cavalier once more if we decide to go again to Princeton.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mimi.</span><br />
</div>

<p>I saw Cora Lantier in New York. She is going up to the
Williams Commencement with a <i>very dear</i> friend. Don't tell
this to Mr. Sidell.</p></div>

<p>There are, of course, three ways of contemplating
a letter written by a young lady, according
to whether the recipient be a friend,
is in love, or being in love, loves without hope.
Skippy used all three methods. That night he
placed four pairs of trousers to press under his
mattress, discarded the dicky (a labor saving
device formed by the junction of two cuffs and
a collar which snapped into place and fulfilled
the requirements of table etiquette), and
painted the ends of his fingers with iodine to
break himself of the habit of living on his nails.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday, Mr. Sidell being
still, as it were, under absent treatment, Mr.
Turkey Reiter making the fourth, Skippy experienced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the terrifying joy of sitting in the
back seat next to Miss Mimi Lafontaine.</p>

<p>"You bad boy, why didn't you answer my
letter?" said that young lady, after a careful
inspection of the embarrassed Skippy had resulted
in much increased satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I wrote you three times," he said, staring
at his shoes.</p>

<p>"Three&mdash;then they must have gone to the
school."</p>

<p>"I tore them up," he said, under his voice.</p>

<p>Between a feminine nineteen and a masculine
fifteen, much is permissible. Miss Mimi, under
protection of the rug, slid her little hand into
his painfully-scrubbed one.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" she said softly.</p>

<p>"Gee!"</p>

<p>It was not exactly the last word in romance,
but it came from the heart, a sort of final gasp as
Skippy felt the waters closing above him. With
her hand in his, something rose in his throat
and he had to fight back the dimming of his
eyes. By the time they rolled into Princeton
there was no longer need of explanation. He
felt that she knew beyond the shadow of a mistake,
just what he felt for her, he, Skippy, who
had never loved before. Of course she was not
pledged. That he comprehended. She was yet
to be won. The years between them were
nothing. Josephine Beauharnais was older
than Napoleon. By the time they returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the school, he had opened his heart impulsively
and spread before the astonished ideal of his
affections the treasures of his inventive imagination.
Miss Lafontaine had been sympathetic.
She had understood at once. She had rather
lightly passed over the Bedelle Improved Bathtub.
The subject, of course, was a delicate one;
but the idea of mosquito-proof stockings had
captured her imagination. With her faith acquired
he could wait for years the coming opportunity.</p>

<p>"Why, Jack, I never heard of such an imagination,"
she said, converting an explosive laugh
into a sneeze in the nick of time.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just a beginning," he said confidently.
"I've got bigger things than that
stored away."</p>

<p>"Why, you'll be richer than Rockefeller!"</p>

<p>"That's only a small part of it," he said
carelessly. What of course he had wished her
to know, and he flattered himself that he had
done it with great delicacy, was that he was a
prize worth waiting for.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell Mr. Sidell about Cora, did
you?" said Mimi irrelevantly, as they arrived
at the school and she began anxiously to scan
the passing groups.</p>

<p>"You bet I didn't, good Lord, no, Mimi."</p>

<p>"I was sure I could trust you," said Miss
Lafontaine,&mdash;who of course had hoped for
quite a different issue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gee! this has been one day," he said, half
smothered with emotion.</p>

<p>"Has it really?" said the young lady, giving
his arm a little squeeze.</p>

<p>"I shall never, never forget."</p>

<p>"Jack, that's what they all say."</p>

<p>Her skepticism pained him. He wanted to do
something, something heroic to show her the
manly quality of his devotion.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there's any chance of your
getting permission to come back with us for
dinner," said Clara Bedelle to Turkey.</p>

<p>"About as much chance as my passing a
Bible exam," said Turkey cheerfully.</p>

<p>A great idea smote down on Skippy,&mdash;he
would accomplish the impossible!</p>

<p>"Swear to keep a secret, Mimi?" he said in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"I shall call on you at exactly nine thirty
to-night."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, but we're ages away."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make? There is
something I've just got to say to you."</p>

<p>"But if they catch you!"</p>

<p>"They won't."</p>

<p>"But, Jack, how will you get there?"</p>

<p>"I'll come on the run," said Skippy gorgeously;
which proved that if his experience
was limited he had certain intuitions to build
upon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When Skippy directly after supper bolted to
his room and began to scrub for the superlative
toilette, after collecting a pair of kid gloves
from Butcher Stevens and a purple tie from
Dennis de Brian de Boru, Snorky Green was
finally convinced that matters had reached a
serious pass.</p>

<p>"I thought you were in New York," he said,
remembering Skippy's previous declaration.</p>

<p>"What? Oh yes!" Skippy, whose mind was
not on consistency, hastily caught himself.
"Oh, Tina! She came down to meet me."</p>

<p>"What in the mischief are you up to
now?"</p>

<p>"For the love of Pete don't bother me," said
Skippy. "Tell you later. Honest, Snorky, it's
serious, and I'm in a devil of a hurry."</p>

<p>He struggled into his best pair of low blacks,
and suddenly a new perplexity arose. What
would they look like after five miles tramp
through the fields and the dust? Yet if he
openly pocketed a shoebrush and cloth, how
explain this to the ever-incredulous Snorky?
The window was open. He simulated a final
polish and profiting by a favorable moment
tossed the brush and cloth out into the dark.
Then he stationed himself before the mirror for
the final struggle to achieve a part.</p>

<p>"Looks like last year's toothbrush," said
Dennis de Brian de Boru, via the transom, his
usual defensive position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looks like the home rooster when the imported
bantam has left," said Snorky.</p>

<p>"Looks like a cat that's walked in the
mucilage."</p>

<p>"That'll be quite enough," said Skippy,
whose patience was evaporating.</p>

<p>"Vaseline'll do the trick," said Dennis
softly.</p>

<p>Vaseline! Skippy seized upon the idea in
desperation. But to his horror, once the part
was achieved, the slippery and sticky effect of
the flattened hair was horrifying.</p>

<p>"Where in Moses is that Irishman!" he cried,
slamming open the door.</p>

<p>"Face powder will take the shine off," said
Snorky, after an immersion of the head in the
washbasin had aggravated the catastrophe.</p>

<p>"My Lord, I've got to do something," said
Skippy, almost in tears. Snorky came to his
rescue and between a vigorous rubbing with a
bath towel and a liberal sprinkling of talcum
powder, an effect was finally produced which at
least was not shiny. Skippy, who had been
glancing at his watch every three minutes,
ended his toilette in a whirl.</p>

<p>"How much money have you got?"</p>

<p>Snorky produced three quarters.</p>

<p>"I'll send it back to you if I don't return."</p>

<p>A light burst over Snorky, confirming his
worst suspicions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Skippy," he said, seizing his arm, "you're
running away! You're going on the stage!"</p>

<p>He had not thought of this, but he appropriated
the suggestion at once by avoiding a
denial.</p>

<p>"Snorky, old pal," he said solemnly, "stand
by me now. When it's all over I'll write you."</p>

<p>"But, good Lord, Skippy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't try to stop me. My mind's made
up."</p>

<p>"But I say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've given my <i>word</i>," said Skippy tragically.
"If I'm not back by eight o'clock to-morrow
morning, mail this letter to my mother
and give this to the Doctor. Good-bye. God
bless you&mdash;and I'll pay you back the first
money I earn."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Heart of a Brunette</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>HE recovered the shoebrush from under the
window of Tabby, the young assistant
house-master, and tucking it into his pocket,
skirted the outer limits of the school, dodged
behind a fence, and creeping on all-fours, made
a wide detour via the pond and rejoined the high
road to Trenton which lay five dusty miles
away. Luckily the evening was overclouded and
the shadows protecting. His problem was not
simply to arrive at the Lafontaines' at exactly
the hour but to arrive there with a cool and
dignified appearance. It was hot, and the
derby hat pressed down on the vaselined hair
was hotter than anything about him, hotter
even than the parched fields and the steaming
asphalt which yielded to his feet.</div>

<p>"Gosh, I oughter have brought a towel," he
said, when at the end of twenty minutes he
stopped to remove his hat and allow the hot
vapors to escape. He sat down and fanned himself
vigorously. Then he took off his necktie
and collar and placed them in his pocket, and
finally shed his coat under favor of the night.
He could scarcely distinguish the road beneath
him, and several times only saved himself from
sprawling on his nose by a convulsive grasping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at a nearby fence. But what did the toil, the
heat, or the terrors of the night matter? He
was going to see her again. Not only that but
he would come to her surrounded by the romance
of a great danger run, just to sit in
her presence, to hear her voice, to see in her
eyes some tender recognition of what he had
dared for her. This was romance indeed!</p>

<p>A dog came savagely out of the night. How
was he to know that a fence intervened? He
ran a quarter of a mile and again sat down. It
grew hotter; he was dripping from head to foot.
A wagon or two went by, but he did not dare
to ask for a ride, for fear of encountering some
agent of the Doctor's secret police. For, perhaps,
his absence was already discovered and
the alarm had gone out.</p>

<p>The heat and the discomfort somewhat interfered
with the free play of his imagination, but
the quality of romance still kept with him.</p>

<p>"When I'm twenty-one," he said to himself
again and again, in a vague defiance of all the
hostile powers of Society. Only five years and
six weeks intervened before the glowing horizon
of liberty. Did she care? Even that did
not matter. She knew what the future held for
him. The main thing, the thing to cling to, was
that her heart was kind. Of that there could be
no question. How gentle and how understanding
she had been! He could come to her and
tell her anything&mdash;absolutely anything!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good Lord, what a difference it makes to
have some one you can trust," he said solemnly
to the night. "Some one to work for!"</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he reached the outskirts of
Trenton, and having cooled off, put on his collar
and necktie. Then he stopped at a stationer's
to ask his way. A large florid young woman,
chewing gum, was behind the counter, patting
down her oily chestnut curls.</p>

<p>"Say, can you tell me where the Lafontaines
live?" he said with an extra polite bow.</p>

<p>Fortunately she knew and directed him.</p>

<p>"You're one of them Lawrenceville boys,
ain't you?" she said, eyeing with curiosity the
oozy ruffle of his hair.</p>

<p>Skippy was shocked at this easy discovery of
his youth.</p>

<p>"Come off. I'm a member of the Princeton
faculty," he said loftily.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you're one of them Lawrenceville
boys," she said, following him to the door.</p>

<p>He waved back gaily and went skipping up
the street. He arrived before the Lafontaine
mansion with exactly five minutes to spare.
The old Colonial house was set back in a wide
plot and masked by convenient foliage. Skippy,
passing down the side wall, sheltered himself
behind a bush, his heart pumping with excitement,
and drew on the gloves which he had
borrowed from Butcher Stevens. Then extracting
the shoebrush and cloth from his pocket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
he busied himself hurriedly with removing
from his trousers and shoes all traces of the
dusty way he had come. This done, he hid the
brush and cloth under the bush and straightened
up. Unfortunately either the last preparations
or the terrific sentimental strain of
facing his first call upon a member of the opposite
sex had so increased his temperature
that his forehead was again covered with
perspiration.</p>

<p>"Great Willies! I can't go in like this&mdash;if
I only had a handkerchief&mdash;what am I to
do?"</p>

<p>But just at the moment when he had improvised
into a towel the most available part of
his shirt, his heart stood still at hearing above
him the following conversation:</p>

<p>"Mimi, you're a witch," said the voice of
his sister, "I never would have believed it."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, you wanted me to wake him
up. I've done it. Goodness, I never saw any
one go down so quickly. I really believe he's
going to propose! If you could have seen his
funny eyes when he told me that there was
something he just <i>had</i> to say to me."</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake keep it up. It's better
than soap, Mimi. One look at his hands and I
knew he was in love."</p>

<p>"My dear, what do you think&mdash;he's had my
photograph for weeks&mdash;the one I gave you, of
course. Now if that isn't a real romance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"He ought to be spanked, that boy&mdash;stealing
away from school!"</p>

<p>"My dear, he's told me all about his life's
ambitions."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It's something about a bathtub&mdash;some sort
of an invention that's going to revolutionize
the bathtub industry."</p>

<p>"Then it must be the outside of a bathtub,"
said Clara with a sisterly laugh. "Mimi, I
just must hear his proposal."</p>

<p>"You'll laugh and spoil it all."</p>

<p>"On my honor!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Miss Mimi Lafontaine put
on her kindliest smile as ushered in by the maid
Mr. John C. Bedelle came magnificently into
the room, spick and span, cool as the cucumber
is credited to be at any temperature; an immaculate
purple tie blooming under an unsullied
collar, with only a slight pollen on the
carefully-divided hair. How was she to know
that, in five minutes, under the sting of betrayed
confidence and broken illusions, a complete
moral transformation had made of the
urchin a man in the embryo, fired by the burning
impulses of the deadliest hatred?</p>

<p>He did not stumble or wind himself up in the
curtain or upset the bowl of goldfish on the
slight &eacute;tag&egrave;re by the sofa. He came in with a
manner that was so completely nonchalant that
Miss Mimi was manifestly impressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/facing-140.jpg" width="281" height="400" alt="&quot;Really, Jack, I&#39;m beginning to suspect you&#39;re an old hand.&quot; Page 140" title="&quot;Really, Jack, I&#39;m beginning to suspect you&#39;re an old hand.&quot; Page 140" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Really, Jack, I&#39;m beginning to suspect you&#39;re an old hand.&quot; Page 140</span>
</div>

<p>"Why, Jack, you don't look as though you
had <i>run</i> at all," she said encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I picked up a buggy and took it easy,"
he said, seating himself and arranging the
trouser crease with nicety. Then having perceived
under the sofa the telltale slippers of
Miss Clara Bedelle, he added, "I say, how did
you ever keep it from Sis?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she thinks it's another caller," said
Mimi, staring a little. "Really, Jack, I'm beginning
to suspect you're an old hand."</p>

<p>"Well, of course this isn't the first time,"
he said, leaning back and sinking his fists in his
trousers pockets.</p>

<p>Miss Mimi gave a gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, I never, and all you said to me too
about the photograph and the letters you tore
up."</p>

<p>"Did you really believe all that?" said
Skippy with a smile that seemed to cut across
his face. His heart was bursting; yet the task
of revenge was sweet. "You know Sidell and
I are old hunting partners."</p>

<p>Miss Lafontaine sat upright, forgetting
everybody in the dismay of her discovery.</p>

<p>"Jack Bedelle, do you mean to say that it
was all fixed up between you two?"</p>

<p>Again Mr. John C. Bedelle smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, we know a trick or two, even if we're
still in school."</p>

<p>Miss Mimi's look was not such as is generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ascribed to the gentler sex. She bit her
lip and said furiously:</p>

<p>"You just tell Mr. Sidell&mdash;" and then, quite
suffocated with rage, she stopped and flung a
little fan, furiously, across the room.</p>

<p>"Now I see her as she is," thought Skippy
with a healing delight. Aloud he added: "Oh,
if you really want to know the truth about
Sidell, just ask Sis. She probably put him up
to the whole game."</p>

<p>Now this was rather crude, and at another
time Miss Lafontaine would have detected the
artifice and consequently divined the whole
fabrication, but at present she was quite too
angry, particularly when she realized that her
best friend was a witness to her discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Just what do you mean by that?" she said
angrily.</p>

<p>"Why, they've been sweet on each other for
a couple of years," he said, with malice aforethought.
"Guess you're not on to Sis. She'd
steal anything with pants on that came within
a mile of her. Ask her sometime about the
mash notes the plumber's boy used to shoot up
to her window, or perhaps you'd better not, it
gets her too hot. But anyway I advise you to
keep your eyes open." He rose, for the sudden
shifting of the slippers back of the sofa warned
him it was time to depart.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mimi," he said carelessly. "Two
can play the same game, remember that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, calculating the moment, he bumped
into the &eacute;tag&egrave;re, upsetting the goldfish, and as
the dripping figure of Miss Clara Bedelle
emerged with a scream, Mr. Skippy Bedelle,
Chesterfieldian to the last, departed saying:</p>

<p>"He laughs best who laughs last."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He arrived at the little stationery shop without
having seen where he had been going, his
eyes blinded with rage, his mind filled with
bitter imprecations. Of his night's infatuation
not a vestige remained except the weakness of
disillusionment and the suffering of a proud
nature.</p>

<p>"Well, Professor, how was your girl?"</p>

<p>He looked up to see the dark-complexioned
lady still methodically chewing away.</p>

<p>"She's like all the rest," he thought darkly,
"fooling some man, I bet."</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell on a group of photographs
in the shape of postal cards; a wonderful assortment
of fleshlings, of young ladies who dazzle
and display abundant charms before the footlights.
He remembered that an explanation
was due to Snorky, and that the explanation
would have to be very convincing. One photograph
fascinated him; it was so like the way
Tina would look, if there were a Tina!</p>

<p>The young lady in graceful tights, legs
crossed in a figure four, elbow resting on a
marble column, her chin supported by the index<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
finger, was smiling out at him with a full dental
smile.</p>

<p>"Say, do a fellow a favor?" he said.</p>

<p>"Sure for a nice boy like you I will," she
said, encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Just sign across here&mdash;it's a joke."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a joke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Sign 'Faithfully yours,'&mdash;no&mdash;'Fondly
yours.'"</p>

<p>"Fondly yours," said the gum chewer, writing
with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Tina."</p>

<p>"T&mdash;I&mdash;N&mdash;A."</p>

<p>"Turner."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I'll not!" said the girl with sudden
indignation. "Turner's my name, and I can't
have any such picture&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right, make it 'Tanner' then."</p>

<p>With the photograph as evidence safely bestowed
in an inner pocket, he set out on the
long homeward trudge. The weakness was
gone, his imagination was now all on the story
he would have to tell Snorky. Heavens, what
had been crowded into one short hour;&mdash;love,
treachery, revenge and triumph! Once a sudden
rush of tears caught him, but he fought
down the mood. The test had been soul-trying,
but the victory was his. So he marched along,
blowing out his courage as he chanted a defiant
marching song and if Providence had but endowed
him with a tail, he would have carried it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
proudly like a banner as he stalked across the
campus and found his way into the Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" said a startled voice.</p>

<p>"Hush, it's Skippy."</p>

<p>"Thank God."</p>

<p>Snorky jumped up and caught him in his
arms with such genuine emotion that Skippy
was profoundly touched, so touched that he almost
made a clean breast of this affair&mdash;almost
but not quite.</p>

<p>"What happened? You look all shot to
pieces," said Snorky, holding up a candle and
gazing at him in awe.</p>

<p>"It's all over," said Skippy stonily.</p>

<p>"Over."</p>

<p>"She'd have had to give up her career and&mdash;and
I'm too young yet to support her."</p>

<p>"Honest, Skippy?" said Snorky, with a lingering
doubt.</p>

<p>"Here's all that's left to me now," said
Skippy, and he brought forth the photograph.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Worldly Wisdom of Skippy Bedelle</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Skippy Bedelle (rage and disillusionment
in his heart) had tramped five
weary miles back from the city which sheltered
that angel of perfidy, Miss Mimi Lafontaine,
he said to himself on waking the next morning:</div>

<p>"Well, by the Great Horned Spoon, that's
one thing I won't bite at again." And examining
himself in the glass with a new respect&mdash;for
after all he had handled the situation with
magnificent impertinence and if the story was
to be retailed in the home circles it would never
be introduced by Miss Clara Bedelle&mdash;examining
himself, then, with a certain pride and
satisfaction he said vaingloriously, "Hurray,
I'm vaccinated!"</p>

<p>"How d'ye mean vaccinated?" said Snorky
whose head emerged via the morning jersey.</p>

<p>"Did I say vaccinated?" said Skippy surprised
and cautious.</p>

<p>"You certainly did," said his chum, who observing
the rapidity of his contact with the
washbasin, the reappearance of the dicky and
the two strokes of the brush which completed
his toilette, added with a sigh of relief, "I say,
old horse, you look more natural."</p>

<p>Skippy immediately returned to the convenient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Tina Tanner. He picked up the statuesquely
posed photograph, contemplated it and
returned it to its place with the air of a man
on whom a great passion has burned itself out.</p>

<p>"She was an awfully decent little sort," he
said meditatively, "but it would have been an
awful mess if I'd done it."</p>

<p>"Done what?"</p>

<p>"Followed her on the stage."</p>

<p>"Say, whatever made you think you'd succeed
on the stage, you chump?" said Snorky,
who always retained a lingering doubt when
Skippy grew confidential.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, the way you got off 'Horatius at the
Bridge'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Skippy stretched his arms and yawned deliciously.</p>

<p>"Gee, but a fellow can make an awful fool
of himself," he said, thinking now not of the
fictitious Tina but of the explanations which
must have taken place between his sister and
Miss Lafontaine.</p>

<p>"A nice wreck you'd have made of your life,
you big boob," said Snorky taking up the
photograph and smelling it curiously to see
what perfume an actress employed. "So her
name's Tanner, eh?"</p>

<p>"Her stage name."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have married a woman like
that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a word against her."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow are you vaccinated?"</p>

<p>"Bitten, vaccinated and cured!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Now when Skippy spoke thus from his heart
it was in absolute faith, without the slightest
suspicion of the natural course which a habit
inevitably must take. A habit is after all but
an acquired appetite, and what appetite was
ever begun with instant enjoyment! No inveterate
smoker ever appreciated his first cigar
and the most persistent of tipplers choked once
over the first distasteful introduction to the
demon rum.</p>

<p>So be it recorded in this history of the sentimental
progress of Skippy Bedelle. The
impulse which sends the boy back to a second
trial of the cigar that stretched him pale and
nauseated on the ground, or leads him to a new
attempt at the alcoholic mixture which scorched
his throat, alone may explain how it came to
pass that Skippy, after the first disillusioning
contact with the opposite sex in the person of
Miss Mimi Lafontaine, should in the first week
of his summer vacation have fallen under the
despotism of Miss Dolly Travers.</p>

<p>There were, as will be seen, extenuating circumstances
and perhaps likewise much may be
explained by the instinctive belief which is implanted
in mankind, that woman is twofold, and
that the brunettes of the species are less deadly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
than the blondes, or vice versa, according to the
first contact.</p>

<p>When Skippy Bedelle arrived for the long
summer vacation at the family home at Gates
Harbor, he arrived with a fixed program which
is here detailed in the order of its importance.</p>

<p>1. To grow at least two inches and to acquire
an added ten pounds in weight.</p>

<p>2. To achieve this necessary progression
towards his athletic ambitions, to sleep at least
fourteen hours of the day and to eat steadily
and consistently during the remaining ten.</p>

<p>3. To impress the governor with the necessity
of increasing his allowance.</p>

<p>4. To conceal from his mother the devastation
of that portion of his wardrobe which is
not a matter of public display.</p>

<p>5. To reduce sisters No. 1 and No. 2 to an
attitude of proper respect, consistent with the
approaching dignity of his sixteen years.</p>

<p>6. To thrash Puffy Ellis for the third consecutive
summer.</p>

<p>7. To obtain permission for a two weeks'
visit to the home of his chum, Snorky Green.</p>

<p>In all of which, be it observed that the
feminine portion of society occupied not the
slightest place.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On a radiant afternoon in mid-June, Skippy,
having finished the last bar of peanut brittle
and made sure that no vestige remained of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
box of assorted chocolates which had preceded
it down the Great Hungry Way, assembled
three comic weeklies and four magazines, gave
the porter a quarter for his ostentatious devotions
and descended at the station, with exactly
seven cents in his pocket, having calculated
his budget to a nicety.</p>

<p>His patent leathers were in a decidedly
shabby condition and cracked over the instep,
but his brown and green check suit, the yellow
tie and the new panama with the purple and
white band were irreproachably <i>bon ton</i>. He
stood a moment supporting himself on a light
bamboo cane, contemplating his dress suit-case,
which he acknowledged was not up to form.
Not only had the straps rotted away, but there
were strange depressions and bulges in it due
to the Waladoo Bird's two hundred and twenty
pounds having fallen upon it. Furthermore,
it was stained with the marks of a root beer
orgy and Snorky Green's mistaken efforts to
remove the same stains with a pumice stone.</p>

<p>Skippy after a moment's deliberation, decided
not to insult the hackman with an offer
of seven cents and having consigned the unspeakable
bag to the truckman proceeded on
foot twirling his cane and trying to appear unaware
of the admiration of the villagers who
were particularly impressed by his perfect
pants.</p>

<p>The Bedelle homestead was a large ornamental,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
turreted and bastioned mansion, consonant
with Mr. Bedelle's increasing prosperity
and Mrs. Bedelle's social importance.</p>

<p>"Gee, the Governor certainly ought to stand
for a raise," said Skippy to himself, with a
proper appreciation of the velvety lawns, the
flower gardens and the green and white stables.
Then he remembered the none too brilliant
record of the scholastic year which was sure
to come up for discussion and fell into a sudden
despondency.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Girls as an Epidemic</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>AS he turned up the walk, sister No. 2, aged
fourteen and a half, came romping off the
porch and the following conversation took
place.</div>

<p>"Hello, Jack."</p>

<p>"Hello, Tootsie."</p>

<p>"You idiotic boy, why didn't you telegraph?"</p>

<p>"What's the use? I'm here," said Skippy
to whom a quarter of a dollar was an object of
reverence.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me?"</p>

<p>Skippy glanced around.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, he's got a cane!"</p>

<p>"Say, who let you put your hair up anyhow!"</p>

<p>"I'm fifteen."</p>

<p>"Come off."</p>

<p>"I say, Jack, awful glad to see you, honest,
and let's stop fighting this summer. You help
me and I'll help you."</p>

<p>Skippy looked at her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Getting on society airs," he thought, but
out loud he announced: "All right, Tootsie, but
see you don't begin. And if you want to help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
out, tell the Governor to make my birthday
present in cash. I'm awfully strapped."</p>

<p>"Now for old Clara," he said to himself and
remembering the last encounter when he had
upset the gold fish over her, he braced himself
for the shock. But to his profound amazement
Miss Bedelle was honey itself.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Jack, how big you've
grown," she said after he had submitted to the
second sisterly embrace, "and such style, too!
What a fascinating tie! Dad and mother are
out but Sam's just home. Come on up and see
how nicely I've arranged your room. How are
you anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Hard up," said Skippy instantly.</p>

<p>"Would this help any?" said Miss Clara
extracting a ten dollar bill from a well-filled
purse.</p>

<p>Skippy gulped in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Gee, sis, are you going to be married?"</p>

<p>"The idea, you funny boy!" said his sister,
blushing violently. "Run on now and see
Sam."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with everyone anyhow?"
said Skippy to himself. "There's a
reason. There certainly is a dark reason."</p>

<p>Still pondering over the motives for this unaccountable
reception he proceeded along the
hall, to the room of his heart's idol, his brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Sam, senior at Yale and star of the nine, Sambones
Bedelle, known at school as Skippy the
first, about whose athletic prowesses the tradition
still remained.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" said the great man at the
sound of his knock. "Skippy? Come in and
let's look you over."</p>

<p>"Hello, Sambo," said the young idol-worshipper,
sidling in.</p>

<p>The older brother caught his hand, slapped
him on the back and held him off for inspection.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you young rascal, you're sprouting
up fast. Whew, what a suit! Pretty
strong, bub&mdash;pretty strong."</p>

<p>"I say, do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I've worn worse. Paid for?"</p>

<p>"No-o&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Anything left of the allowance?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Not possible!"</p>

<p>"Seven cents."</p>

<p>"Could you use a five spot?"</p>

<p>"Gee, Sam!"</p>

<p>"All right, all right. Pick it out over there
on the bureau. How's your conduct?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good."</p>

<p>Skippy, perched on the window-seat, watched
with an approving eye the splendors that a
college education had bestowed. Sam's hair
parted without a rebellious ripple and lay down
in perfect discipline. There never were such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
immaculate white flannel trousers, such faultless
buckskin shoes and tie, while the socks and
the touch of handkerchief which bloomed from
the breastpocket were a perfect electric blue.</p>

<p>"Well, Skippy, I'll have to look you over,"
said Sam carelessly. "Time you had a few
pointers. What did you do at school?"</p>

<p>"Substitute on the eleven and left field on
the house nine," said Skippy, who understood
at once the meaning of such an inquiry.</p>

<p>"First rate. Haven't started on the demon
cigarette yet?"</p>

<p>Skippy hesitated.</p>

<p>"Let's see your fingers," said the mentor,
who perceiving no telltales traces of nicotine
grunted a qualified approval. "Well, how
much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a few whiffs now and then up the
ventilator. You know how it is, Sambo!"</p>

<p>"Cut it out this summer. Your business is
to grow. Savvy? If ever I catch you, you
young whipper-snapper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Sam."</p>

<p>Skippy the first held him a moment with a
stern and disciplinary eye and then relaxing,
said as he contemplated the hang of his trousers
before the mirror, "I hear you've started in
to be a fusser."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" said Skippy with the
rising inflection.</p>

<p>"I ran in on Turkey Reiter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," said Skippy relaxing. "With Miss
Lafontaine? That was all a put-up game!"</p>

<p>Sam considered him and noting the fatuous
smile shook his head and said:</p>

<p>"Well, bub, you're at the age when they fall
fast and easy. Now listen to a few pearls of
wisdom. Got your ears open?"</p>

<p>"Fire away, Sambo!"</p>

<p>"If you've <i>got</i> to fall and you will&mdash;sure
you will, don't shake your head&mdash;if you've
got to fall, don't trail around on an old woman's
skirts and get treated like a dog&mdash;fetch and
carry stuff. Look the field over and pick out
something young and grateful. Something
easy. Something that'll look up to you. Let
her love you. Be a hero. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Huh! Girls give me a swift pain," said
Skippy with a curl of his upper lip.</p>

<p>"Wait and count the pains," said Sam with
a grin. "You're at a bad age. Well, I have
spoken. What's the use of having an older
brother if he can't do you some good?"</p>

<p>It being only four o'clock, Skippy decided to
look up the Gutter Pup, who with the Egghead,
represented the school contingent at Gates
Harbor. Lazelle, more familiarly known as the
Gutter Pup, Gazelle, Razzle-dazzle and the
White Mountain Canary according to the fighting
weight of the addressee, lived just across
lots.</p>

<p>With three months' respite ahead from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
tyranny of the chapel bell, three months of
home cooking, fifteen dollars in his pocket and
nothing to do but to romp like a colt over pastures
of his own choosing, Skippy went hilariously
over the lawns, hurdled a hedge and
hallooed from below the well-known window.</p>

<p>"Hi there, old Razzle-Dazzle, stick your head
out!"</p>

<p>A second and a third peremptory summons
bringing no response, he went cautiously
around the porch.</p>

<p>"Why it's Jack Bedelle," said the Gutter
Pup's sister from a hammock. "Gracious, I
never should have known you!"</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," said Skippy, acknowledging
with a start the difference a year had
brought to the tomboy he had known. "Say,
you've done some growing up yourself."</p>

<p>He ended in a long drawn out whistle which
Miss Lazelle smilingly accepted as a tribute.</p>

<p>"I say, Bess, where's the old Gazelle?"</p>

<p>"Charlie? Why he's gone out canoeing
with Kitty Rogers."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Miss Lazelle repeated the information.
Skippy was too astounded to remember his
manners. He clapped his hat on his head, sunk
his fists in his pockets and went out the gate.
The Gutter Pup spending his time like that!
He made his way to the club where more shocks
awaited him. On the porch was the Egghead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
feeding ice cream to Mimi Lafontaine. On the
tennis courts Puffy Ellis and Tacks Brooker
were playing mixed doubles! Skippy could not
believe his eyes. What sort of an epidemic
was this anyhow? He went inside and immediately
a victrola started up a two-step
and lo and behold, there before him whirling
ecstatically about the floor, held in feminine
embraces, were Happy Mather and Joe Crocker,
the irreconcilables of the old gang!</p>

<p>"Hello, Skippy, shake a foot," said Happy
Mather encouragingly. "Want to be introduced?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Skippy loftily. "What's
happened to the crowd? Can't you think of
anything better than wasting your time like
this?"</p>

<p>"Wake up!" said Happy, making a dive for
a partner. "You're walking in your sleep."</p>

<p>Skippy went sadly out and down to the
bridge where he perched on a pile and contemplated
the swirling currents with melancholy.
What had happened? After an hour of
bitter rumination he rose heavily and engrossed
in his own thoughts passed two ice-cream
parlors, utterly forgetful of the sudden
wealth in his pockets. On the way home he
perceived something white and pink moving
lightly in airy freedom, while at her side laden
to the shoulder with sweaters, rugs, a camp
stool and a beach umbrella was Sam. He came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
rebelliously to the home porch and then hastily
ducked around to the side entrance, for the
porch was in full possession of Clara who was
entertaining a group of men. He sought to
gain his room noiselessly via the back parlor
and came full upon Tootsie who was showing
a book of photographs to a pudgy, red-haired
boy, who blushed violently at his intrusion and
stood up, until he had acknowledged the embarrassed
introduction and escaped.</p>

<p>"What in thunder's gotten into everybody
anyhow?" he said to himself disconsolately.
"Girls, girls everywhere. The place is full of
them and everybody twosing, twosing! What
in Sam Hill is a regular fellow to do! Gee, but
it's going to be a rotten summer!"</p>

<p>So in this melancholy seclusion, gazing out of
his window, at the green landscape vexed by
the omnipresent flash of white skirts, uneasily
conscious that a crisis had arrived in his social
progress that would have to be met, Skippy
began to commune with himself and likewise
to ruminate. His first contact with female
perfidy had destroyed half his faith in woman;
never again could he trust a brunette. Some
day he might permit himself to be appreciated
by a blonde, but it would take a lot of convincing.
But it is one thing to have fixed principles
and another to resist the contagions of a whole
society. Virtue is one thing but loneliness is
another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"What the deuce is a regular fellow going to
do?" he said. But already his resentment had
given way to a brooding anxiety. All at once,
he remembered that he too had loved. Something
that had been dormant awoke, as the
touch of spring awoke the great outdoors.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For I must love some one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And it may as well be you."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The refrain haunted him. Had the time
come when even he would have to descend?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Blonde of the Species</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>SUNDAY was a nerve-racking problem in
days when the New England tradition still
held. There was no fishing, no tennis, no baseball,
and no golf. Picnics were taboo. There
was of course a large amount of eating to be
done, but after fish-balls, griddle cakes, and
pork and beans for breakfast, a heavy sermon,
and a heavier roast beef for dinner, the long
afternoon had to be lived through in a sort of
penitential expiation. One dozen fed-to-bursting,
painfully primped young human colts,
ranging from fifteen to seventeen years of age,
gathered in the Gutter Pup's barn and mournfully
debated the eternal question of what to do.</div>

<p>"It's too cold to sneak up to the old swimming
hole," said Tacks disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Why not have a few rounds with the
mitts?" said the Gutter Pup eagerly.</p>

<p>"In these duds?" said Happy Mather, who
preferred to stand because when he sat down
the Sunday collar pinched his throat. "Nothing
doing! Thank you, but my governer's hand
is still strong!"</p>

<p>"We might organize a Browning Society,"
said Puffy Ellis, who came from Boston.</p>

<p>"Bright boy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well, since we 're all dressed up and
nowhere to go, we might as well do the society
racket and call on the sweet things."</p>

<p>"Girls!" said Skippy, sarcastically. "My
aunt's cat's pants! Joe, what's got into you!
You used to be human last summer. Girls!
Girls! I vote we all go out and pick a
bunch of dandelions for Joe Crocker to carry
round."</p>

<p>"Hold up," said the Gutter Pup. "You give
me an idea."</p>

<p>"If it's got anything to do with skirts," said
Skippy, "au revoir and likewise good-by. I
resign."</p>

<p>"Shut up! When Razzle-dazzle starts to
think, give him a chance," said Happy Mather.
"Who asked your opinion? You're nothing
but a tadpole, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the idea?" said Tacks.</p>

<p>"It's a good one," said the Gutter Pup
slowly. "It's a gag we used to pull off in the
old Murray Hill Gang, the winter I put Spider
Martin away in seven rounds. Spider was no
great shakes with the mitts but he had some
bright ideas. This is one of them. How many
are we?"</p>

<p>"Twelve."</p>

<p>"Just right. Only it's got to be played dead
serious, no horseplay, kiddin', or rough stuff."</p>

<p>Just half an hour later Miss Connie Brown,
aged sixteen, who was yawning over a novel on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the chaise-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'longue'">lounge</ins> of her bedroom, was electrified
into action by the announcement that two
gentlemen callers were waiting for her in the
parlor. Miss Connie was in excellent health,
weighing one hundred and sixty pounds, rather
freckled, and quite accustomed to watch her
girl friends enjoying themselves in the ballroom.
She bounded down the stairs and arrived,
slightly out of breath, to find the Gutter
Pup and Skippy stiffly erect.</p>

<p>"Allow me to present my friend, Mr. Bedelle!"
said the Gutter Pup in the correct tones
of an undertaker.</p>

<p>Miss Connie shook hands vigorously and
said, beaming with surprised delight:</p>

<p>"I think it's just too darling of you to drop
in. Every one's out and I was trying to read a
poky old book. We'll have tea and there's
some chocolate cake left. Course I know your
sister, Mr. Bedelle. I think she's just the
dandiest girl."</p>

<p>"I hope your father and mother are well,"
said Skippy gravely.</p>

<p>"What? Oh, yes! They're all right. Let's
be cozy and camp down over here."</p>

<p>"And your sister?" said the Gutter Pup with
equal punctiliousness.</p>

<p>"Sis? Oh, she's fine and dandy," said Miss
Connie, curling up on the sofa, after lighting
the lamp under the tea kettle.</p>

<p>Skippy and the Gutter Pup after this irreproachable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
beginning, sat up stiffly and, retiring
into a set silence, stared very hard at
their hostess.</p>

<p>"You'll have a bit of chocolate cake, won't
you?" said the young lady, wondering how to
open the conversation.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Bedelle?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>At this moment the bell rang and the maid
announced:</p>

<p>"Mr. Mather and Mr. Crocker callin' on you,
Miss Connie."</p>

<p>Miss Brown could not believe her ears. Such
a thing had never happened before, even in her
happiest dreams. If her sister could only see
her now! She gave a hurried calculating glance
at the chocolate cake and went joyfully more
than halfway to meet the new arrivals. The
four conspirators, after formal greetings,
ranged themselves in a semicircle, stiffly balanced
on the edges of their chairs, hands on
their knees, and waited for their hostess to play
with the conversation.</p>

<p>"Did you see Maude Adams in her new piece
this spring?" said Miss Connie, who began to
fidget with the cups and carefully cut the cake
into five exact divisions.</p>

<p>As this question was addressed to the company
in general, the four visitors maintained a
frozen attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm just crazy about Maude Adams. I
went three times," said Miss Connie, who
found that five teacups choked up the table in
the most disconcerting way. "You like Maude
Adams, don't you&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Mather?"</p>

<p>"I like Maude Adams."</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Brooker?"</p>

<p>"I like Maude Adams."</p>

<p>Miss Connie was staring at the teapot desperately,
seeking for some new topic of conversation,
when again the bell rang and two more
callers were announced. Miss Connie's Cinderella-like
enthusiasm gave way to a feeling of
panic. She whispered hoarsely to the maid to
bring two more cups and surreptitiously made
a new allotment of the chocolate cake. The new
arrivals inquired solemnly after the health of
Miss Connie's mother, father and sister, and
then joined the expectant silence. When the
young lady in turn had discovered that the
new callers liked Maude Adams, all mental processes
came to an end and the sound of the clock
from the mantel fell like the blows of a hammer
in the room.</p>

<p>When the fourth relay arrived, her complexion
took on a bright red tinge and her agitation
was such that she poured the cream into the
cake and broke two cups.</p>

<p>"Did you see her!" said the Gutter Pup
ecstatically, after they had allowed the pent-up
hilarity to die out behind the sheltering hedge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"Skippy, old top, when that last bunch arrived,
I thought she certainly was going down for the
count."</p>

<p>"Her eyes were jumping and she was breathing
like a horse."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like the idea?"</p>

<p>"Best Sunday afternoon I ever spent."</p>

<p>"Where away now?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to work it on Tootsie."</p>

<p>"Hold up&mdash;my sister needs it more than
yours."</p>

<p>The point was debated and as no decision
could be reached it was decided to keep to the
regular program. The afternoon was a huge
success from the point of view of the male
phalanx. The destruction was enormous. One
or two young ladies held out until the fifth relay
but almost collapsed at the fourth.</p>

<p>"'Course they'll all get together to-morrow
and have it in for us," said the Gutter Pup,
chortling. "But never mind, it was worth it.
Did you ever see anything as idiotically solemn
as Tacks Brooker? When he arrives they certainly
throw up the sponge."</p>

<p>"Have we time for another?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it's only a quarter of six. We'll put
this one over hard, for she certainly needs taking
down."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Dolly Travers. Don't know her? You
will."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Dolly Travers received them with the
manner of a Dresden shepherdess just stepping
from the mantelpiece and Skippy took the petite
hand gingerly, as though afraid that anything
so delicate and brittle would break at the touch.
The voice of his brother's worldly wisdom
seemed to sound in his ears:</p>

<p>"Pick out something young and grateful.
Be a hero."</p>

<p>Miss Travers was undeniably young, if artful,
and moreover she was not of the dark
and deceptive class of brunettes, but a blonde,
with eyes as open and guileless as the blue of
the June day. She had solved the problem of
the classification which as naturally marks the
feminine progress as long trousers indicates
the man, by bobbing her hair; and, though the
subterfuge seemed to afford much amusement
to certain of her sex, it immediately separated
her from the pigtails.</p>

<p>There was something about her that appealed
instantly to Skippy and inspired confidence,
something cool and dainty and at ease.
She did not express either surprise or excessive
delight at their entrance. There was something
simple and frank about everything she did. He
appreciated it and fell to wishing that Tootsie
would be more like her, less coquettish and
more of a good comrade.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know?" said Dolly, looking
at the Gutter Pup.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I hope your mother and father are well,"
said Skippy, true to the formula.</p>

<p>"Gracious! Are you trying to make conversation?"
said Dolly, beginning to laugh, "Don't
sit on the edge of your chairs, boys, like monkeys
on a stick; sit back and be comfortable."</p>

<p>Happy Mather and Tacks appeared with
gloomy ceremony.</p>

<p>"Is this the first time you ever paid a call?"
said the young lady when Happy had opened
the question of the family health. "What is
the matter with you boys? You look too ridiculous
for words; sit back, stick your hands in
your pockets, and look natural."</p>

<p>Again the bell rang and the sounds of the
third relay were heard in the hall. Miss Dolly
glanced quickly at the four solemnities and then
suspiciously out of the window where relays
four and five were lurking under the trees,
suppressed a smile, and came to a sudden decision.</p>

<p>"My mother and father are in perfect health,
my sister is in perfect health, how are yours?"
she said, as Puffy Ellis started to clear his
throat. "No, no, don't sit down. You're much
too imposing. Mr. Crocker, you take one side
of the fireplace and Mr. Ellis the other, and
please don't look so gawky. You aren't really
afraid of one little girl, are you? And by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
way, Charlie Lazelle, go out on the porch and
call in the others."</p>

<p>"Others?" said the Gutter Pup, trying to
save the day by his cat-and-cream expression.</p>

<p>"The others who are hiding under the willow,"
said Dolly lightly. "Hurry up, because
it's six o'clock and Daddy will be back any
moment. He's such a bear about the boys I
go with. It's a marvelous chance for him to
look you over. Joe Crocker, sit down at the
piano."</p>

<p>"On Sunday?" said Joe, startled out of his
attitude.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, we're not going to dance.
We're going to make a good impression on
father."</p>

<p>When Mr. Travers drew up ten minutes later
he beheld eleven sheepish young gentlemen
huddled in a circle in the middle of the parlor
intoning from hymnbooks the measures
which Joe Crocker pounded out from the piano
under the solemn inspection of Miss Dolly
Travers.</p>

<p>"Great heavens! What's this?" said Mr.
Travers, who was the most unorthodox of men.
"What in mischief are you up to now?"</p>

<p>"It's my Sunday School class," said the
young lady, with difficult seriousness. "We're
meeting every week. It won't annoy you too
much, will it, father?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Result of a Brother's Advice</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THE first dance of the summer took place the
following Saturday, and the entire feminine
contingent immediately declared war on Miss
Dolly Travers, who entered escorted by four
cavaliers and subdivided each dance.</div>

<p>While others more fortunately endowed with
rhythmic feet swayed and circled about the
ballroom with the little Dresden china blonde,
Skippy, who guarded in his arms a pink and
white filmy scarf, glowered across the vacant
chair at Puffy Ellis, who had been favored with
the safekeeping of the favorite's fan.</p>

<p>"Jack, you're perfectly ridiculous," said
Sister Clara, who did not relish the competition.
"The idea of making a fool of yourself
over a child of twelve that ought to be in bed
long ago. Haven't you any pride?"</p>

<p>"Kitty, kitty," said Skippy softly. He could
not be bothered with such things as sisters.
His mind was made up. He glared over at
Puffy and said to himself: "To-night I'll give
him his choice. Either he gets off the horizon,
or I tear the hide off him."</p>

<p>He would protect his rights in the good old-fashioned
way, even if he had to thrash a dozen
of them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Jack!" said Dolly, whirling up at this
moment, and sinking back into the scarf which
he hurriedly draped about her. "You look like
blood and thunder. You're not jealous, are
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Well then?"</p>

<p>"Why did you give Puffy Ellis that fan?"</p>

<p>"Poor Puffy! He doesn't dance, either."</p>

<p>"Lord, I'll dance by next Saturday," said
Skippy miserably, "or break a leg."</p>

<p>"Foolish boy, of course you must dance! If
I sit this out with you, will it make you feel any
better?"</p>

<p>"Will it!"</p>

<p>"We'll go on the porch and you'll try a one-step.
Oh, no one will see. Gracious! Don't
look so terrified."</p>

<p>Skippy's answer was something between a
gulp and a gurgle.</p>

<p>"Don't you want <i>me</i> to teach you?" said
Dolly in the velvetiest voice in the world.</p>

<p>"I'll try; I'll try anything you say," he
said, breathing hard, "only I say, Dolly, remember
a cart-horse has done more dancing
than I ever have."</p>

<p>"The two-step is frightfully easy&mdash;you'll
see," said the young lady when they had
reached the dark end of the piazza. "It's just
one-two to music. Put your arm around me!"</p>

<p>"What?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"You goose! How can you dance if you
don't?" said Dolly in a cool professional manner.
"Take my hand. So! Now just walk in
rhythm."</p>

<p>When Skippy for the first time in his life had
actually closed his arm around a feminine waist
and clutched at the outstretched hand, he
had a sensation of terrifying dizziness, such as
had once overcome him when on a dare he had
poised himself thirty feet in the air for his first
high dive.</p>

<p>"Begin! One, two, left foot, to the music!"</p>

<p>Skippy blindly and obediently began to walk.
He walked all over the little feet. He walked
on his own. He walked into a chair and ricocheted
from a table with a bump that bounced
them off the railing.</p>

<p>"That's enough!" said Dolly in a slightly
discouraged voice. "Gracious! You mustn't
grab me like that. You're not drowning."</p>

<p>"Drowning's nothing to this," said Skippy,
rubbing his forehead. "You see it's hopeless."</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't hopeless. If that great
big lummox of a Tacks Brooker can dance
aren't you ashamed of yourself to give up like
that?"</p>

<p>"I'll never dance another step," said Skippy
sulkily.</p>

<p>"The idea, Jack Bedelle! I want you to
dance, and dance you shall!" said Dolly, stamping
her foot. "Do you understand?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">He balanced carefully, stretched out one arm to encircle an imaginary waist. Page 172</span>
</div>

<p>"Don't rub it in, Dolly."</p>

<p>"Foolish boy!" said the young lady, squeezing
his arm. "Do you think I want to dance
all summer long with <i>other</i> men?"</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later Skippy
again, but alone, reached the protecting
shadows. Again the orchestra was beating out
an exhilarating measure.</p>

<p>"You bet I'm not going to let her dance with
other men," he said under his breath. He
balanced carefully, stretched out one arm to encircle
an imaginary waist and started heavily
to tread the illusive measure. Suddenly he
realized that he was not alone. Farther down
a couple were swaying in the shadows. Then
Dolly's voice reached him.</p>

<p>"The idea! Puffy, of course you can dance.
If Jack Bedelle can learn, you ought to be
ashamed to give up."</p>

<p>"Skippy dance!"</p>

<p>"Of course, foolish boy! Do you want to
sit and watch him dance with me <i>all</i> summer?"</p>

<p>That evening after he had escorted the triumphant
Dolly Travers home in company of four
other victims, Skippy went heavily upward to
his room.</p>

<p>"Hello there!" said the big brother from
his bed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sambo," said Skippy, slinking in
disconsolately.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, bub? You look like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
plucked chicken. You've been moping around
for a week. What is the matter with you anyhow?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Skippy, staring
at him.</p>

<p>"Exactly, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"The matter is, I took your advice," said
Skippy reproachfully. "You told me to pick
out something young and easy."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did it," said Skippy, who then,
without noticing Mr. Sam's growing interest,
began to unburden himself.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Three days later, about five in the afternoon,
Skippy emerged from behind the Gutter Pup's
barn, leaving Mr. Puffy Ellis to readjust himself
with more painful leisure. Skippy was
somewhat bruised himself, and his clothes were
a sight to behold, but he was happy. Mr. Puffy
Ellis had finally seen the light and one obstacle
at least had been removed from the summer.</p>

<p>"I may not be much shakes on my feet as
yet," said Skippy to himself grimly, "but
thank the Lord I can use my fists." He remembered
certain gorgeous passages in "The
Count of Monte Cristo" and, thinking of what
still remained to be done, said tragically, "So
much for <i>one!</i>"</p>

<p>Suddenly, in front of the Travers home, he
beheld a buckboard draw up, and as with rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
anger he pressed forward for a view of the next
rival, Miss Dolly Travers tripped down, gave
her hand delightedly, and sprang to the seat.</p>

<p>Another rival, another Puffy Ellis to crush!
Unmindful of anything but his consuming jealousy,
he strode forward, fists doubled and
glowering. The next moment the carriage had
swung up and passed him. Miss Dolly Travers,
blissfully entranced with her new conquest, had
not even noticed him, standing there humbly in
the road! But worse than that&mdash;oh, perfidy
of perfidies&mdash;at the reins was no other than
the great man of the university, his brother Mr.
Sambones Bedelle!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Antics of a Talking Machine</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>TOOTSIE BEDELLE, in the days following
the opening of the summer season at Gates
Harbor, was considerably mystified by the actions
of the family phonograph. Now while a
talking machine is admittedly endowed with one
human attribute, it is supposed to be a talking
and not a walking machine. Yet unless it were
endowed with motive power, how explain the
sudden oddities of its appearances and disappearances?</div>

<p>The evening after the first hop at the club,
Tootsie broke upon the family dinner table
with the frantic announcement:</p>

<p>"The phonograph's gone! Stolen!"</p>

<p>"Stolen!" said Skippy incredulously.</p>

<p>"Stolen!" said Mr. Bedelle with his eat 'em
alive expression.</p>

<p>"Why it was there this morning," said
Clara.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not there now and it wasn't
there this afternoon!"</p>

<p>The entire Bedelle family broke for the parlor.
There in its accustomed corner was the
phonograph. When quiet had been restored
Tootsie again announced.</p>

<p>"It was <i>not</i> there this afternoon!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was there, Tootsie dear?" said Clara
maliciously.</p>

<p>Tootsie's reply woke up Mr. Bedelle, who
considered himself a nervous dyspeptic and, being
already in a state of antidigestive excitation,
glowered and imposed silence on the entire
younger generation.</p>

<p>"Well, it's <i>my</i> phonograph, anyhow!" said
Tootsie sulkily, and dinner over she hastened
to the parlor. The phonograph was still there.
She went to bed a little shaken in her convictions.
But the next morning, returning early
from the beach, she happened to glance into the
parlor. The phonograph had disappeared
again! Tootsie could not believe her eyes. She
advanced cautiously and felt with both hands,
but her groping fingers encountered nothing
but thin air. Then she searched behind the
curtains, moved the furniture and opened all
the hall closets. There was no question about
it this time, the phonograph certainly had
vanished from the house!</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as Mr. and Mrs. Bedelle
were sauntering back from the morning plunge,
the frantic figure of Miss Tootsie came flying
down the road.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Tootsie! What <i>has</i> happened?"
exclaimed Mrs. Bedelle, trying to
remember whether the dioxygen and the bandages
had been unpacked.</p>

<p>"It's gone!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone? What, who, where?"</p>

<p>"The phonograph's gone again."</p>

<p>"Now Tootsie," said Mr. Bedelle, elevating
a cautionary finger.</p>

<p>"Don't agitate yourself, John," said Mrs.
Bedelle.</p>

<p>"Father, it is gone! I saw it!"</p>

<p>"Saw it?"</p>

<p>"I mean I saw it wasn't there and I searched
everywhere. I saw it with my own eyes," said
Tootsie incoherently, and between rage and
tears she repeated her account in a manner to
be completely unintelligible. Mr. Bedelle was
a theorist afflicted with indigestion. He carefully
selected his diet with due regard for
starch values and never ate a raw tomato without
first carefully removing the seeds. He was
likewise particularly careful never to sit down
to a process of digestion in an agitated mood.
His irritation therefore considerably aggravated
by his daughter's case of nerves, he
hastened on to the house.</p>

<p>"I looked everywhere, Daddy, honest I did
and it&mdash;" Suddenly Tootsie stopped and her
jaw fell. There in its accustomed place, reposing
on the table, was the phonograph.</p>

<p>"Tootsie!" said Mr. Bedelle in puffy rage.</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy."</p>

<p>"Go to that machine. Put your hand on it.
Feel it. Is it or is it not a phonograph?"</p>

<p>"It is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy."</p>

<p>"Write out fifty times 'I must not get excited
before mealtime,' Don't leave the house until
you have done it."</p>

<p>"Very well, Daddy."</p>

<p>Mr. Bedelle went to his easy-chair on the
back porch and began to fan himself. Tootsie,
staring at the phonograph, began seriously to
consider. Her suspicions were aroused and her
first suspicion was the instinctive one of sister
to sister.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I believe the child thinks
I did it," said Clara, at luncheon, after Tootsie's
stare had remained in fixed accusation
upon her.</p>

<p>"Not a word! Not another word about that
phonograph," said Mr. Bedelle wrathfully, "If
this whole family has got to be upset every time
I sit down to the table, I will have the whole
thing made into mincemeat."</p>

<p>"Well, it's my phonograph," said Tootsie
sullenly, and immediately departed for her
room&mdash;by request.</p>

<p>For two days the phonograph remained
quiescent, but about this time Miss Clara Bedelle
announced that some one had been tampering
with her figure.</p>

<p>"Your figure, Clara? How shocking!" said
the older brother.</p>

<p>"My dressmaker's figure, and what's more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
some one," said Clara, looking hard at Tootsie,
"<i>Some one</i> has been in my closet and disturbed
my dresses!"</p>

<p>"How <i>very</i> strange," said Tootsie sarcastically.
"Are you sure it isn't your imagination&mdash;child?"</p>

<p>"And I know who did it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know, too, who stole my
phonograph," said Tootsie angrily.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the phonograph departed
for four hours. Tootsie searched her sister's
bedroom and then called Skippy into consultation.</p>

<p>"It's Clara all right," said Skippy. "We
must set a watch on her."</p>

<p>"She has a mean and spiteful nature. She
does it just to get me punished."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"Say, what's it worth?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I get if I catch her red hot?"</p>

<p>"I'll give a dollar," said Tootsie recklessly.</p>

<p>"That's too much," said Skippy, with an
appearance of generosity. "I'll sleuth for a
quarter a day. Cash in advance. But my
orders go. Savvy?"</p>

<p>Tootsie paid down the fee, and following instructions
departed next morning with the
family for the beach, while Skippy, returning
across lots, wriggled on his stomach over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
lawn and slipped into the house by the cellar
window. For three days Tootsie duly paid out
her quarter and received the most comforting
of reports. On the fourth day, however, a discussion
arose.</p>

<p>"'Course if you sit there, no one's goin' to
come," she said, fingering her last quarter. "I
know it's Clara by the look in her eyes."</p>

<p>"Sit there! What kind of a sleuth do you
think I am?" he said indignantly. "Look here.
See that phonograph&mdash;see anything queer
about it? Pick it up."</p>

<p>Instantly the grating sounds of a dinner bell
were heard and a horrible crash.</p>

<p>"Lookout! Don't drop it, you chump! See
that string that passes down the back of the
wall and into the closet?" said Skippy, proudly
exhibiting a patent alarm which he had constructed
with the aid of a delicately balanced
dishpan. "I'm in the dining-room under the
table. Well what?"</p>

<p>"Heavens! If Daddy ever sets that off!"</p>

<p>"He won't. You bet, I'll see to that," said
Skippy hastily. "Well what? Do I get another
quarter?"</p>

<p>There was a slight mental indecision after
which the quarter came reluctantly to the detective.
Tootsie went thoughtfully down to the
beach. The new method did redound to the
stability of the phonograph, but was Skippy
really working as rapidly as he could?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should have offered a dollar and no
more," said Tootsie to herself. "If this keeps
up I'll be broke in a week."</p>

<p>So distressing was this outlook, that her
mind refused to be diverted, and after a brief
hesitation she returned to the house, intent
on a more satisfactory financial arrangement.
Now Tootsie was as fond of mystery stories
as Skippy himself, and so with due regard to
etiquette she dodged down the hedge, slunk
behind the lilacs, and noiselessly let herself
into the dining-room window. Then, cautiously,
on hands and knees, she approached
the mysteries of the dining-room table, behind
the red cloth of which Skippy was to be waiting.</p>

<p>"Hist! It's me," she said in a wary whisper.
Then, having consumed ten minutes in
moving six feet serpent fashion across the
creaky floor, she gained the table. Skippy was
not there. She rose violently, bumping her
head, scrambled out and rushed into the parlor.
The phonograph likewise had disappeared.</p>

<p>"He's on the trail at last," she thought excitedly.
"Hurray!"</p>

<p>But at that precise moment the strangest of
strange, uncanny sounds was heard. Tootsie
stood stock still and listened with a pumping
heart. There was no question about it, the
phonograph was gone, yet faintly, like a sinking
moan, she heard, she was sure she heard, the
thin, tinny sounds of a Sousa two-step. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
room was dim, the house deserted. For one
brief moment she stood panic-stricken, poised
for flight. Then she shook her head angrily.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/facing-182.jpg" width="306" height="400" alt="The partner of his arms, escaping, rolled over towards Tootsie. Page 182" title="The partner of his arms, escaping, rolled over towards Tootsie. Page 182" />
<span class="caption">The partner of his arms, escaping, rolled over towards Tootsie. Page 182</span>
</div>

<p>"Fiddlesticks, phonographs don't have
ghosts!"</p>

<p>And listening more intently, she gradually
located the familiar strains as coming from the
distant carriage house. In a fever of expectancy
Tootsie flew across the lawns and gained the
open door. Above her the phonograph was
pumping out the thrilling measures of the latest
two-step, but what puzzled her immediately
were the scuffling, shifting sounds, like a scurry
of rats, which accompanied it. Then a suspicion
of the truth came to her and she tiptoed
up the stairs. On the open floor Skippy with
his arms about a strange shape was painfully
treading in and out of a maze which, with a
bench, a barrel and two chairs, he had arranged
to visualize the perils of the ballroom.</p>

<p>"Thief!"</p>

<p>Skippy started, shied into the bench and went
over backwards while the partner of his arms,
escaping, rolled over towards Tootsie, discovering
under Clara's best organdie dress the
net-work of wire which made up the missing
dressmaker's form!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Containing Some High Melodrama</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THERE are great moments in life when the
acquired veneer of society drops away and
human beings revert to type. Tootsie lay down
on her back and kicked her legs in the air, howling
with glee. Skippy, disentangling himself
from the bench, rose with slow deliberation.
He saw that he faced a crisis. If Tootsie, now
rolling before him in hysterical agony, ever
was allowed to tell such a story as this, there
would be no future for John C. Bedelle but to
ship before the mast. Skippy thought hard and
Skippy had the instincts of a diplomat. He decided
to begin with a light conciliatory manner.</div>

<p>"Well, Tootsie, old girl, you've got the
goods on me. What's your price?"</p>

<p>Tootsie's reply was a succession of hysterical
gasps that sounded like a child with the
whooping cough laughing over a comic section.</p>

<p>"What's your price?" Skippy repeated
more firmly, but striving to maintain a sickly
smile.</p>

<p>"OW! OW! OW!" said Tootsie, holding in
her sides.</p>

<p>Skippy began to be alarmed. He thought a
moment and then carefully removed the dressmaker's
form and hid it behind a packing-case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
But the sight of Skippy's dancing companion
brought forth a fresh attack of hysterics. Then
he had recourse to water and a dripping oily
sponge. The sight of this so affected Tootsie
that she rose precipitately and staggered to a
chair. Skippy at once abandoned the sponge
and sympathetically proffered his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"It's goin' to cost me a lot of money," he
thought, considering her with anxiety. He had
fifteen dollars stowed away with the intention
of adding it to the cash returns of his approaching
birthday and acquiring his first dress suit.
He made a mental surrender and advancing to
the somewhat calmer Tootsie, a third time
asked:</p>

<p>"Well, come on! What's your price?"</p>

<p>"Thief!" said Tootsie, all at once remembering
her grievance.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, can't you take a joke?"</p>

<p>"A joke! Wait'll I get even with you, Mr.
Smarty!"</p>

<p>"Go easy. Name your terms."</p>

<p>"And I paid you to watch it!" said Tootsie,
whose anger began to rise as her respiration
returned.</p>

<p>Skippy mournfully admitted to himself that
this had been an unnecessary aggravation.</p>

<p>"Shucks! You didn't think I was going to
keep the money, did you?" he said, bringing
out a dollar bill and tendering it humbly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Tootsie put the bill from her with the gesture
of a tragedy queen, stood up, straightened her
skirt and said:</p>

<p>"Just you wait, thief!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"My business."</p>

<p>"You're not going to tell?" said Skippy,
who had no doubt of her intention.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no! Oh no indeed!" said Tootsie,
moving to depart.</p>

<p>Skippy sprang ahead, slammed the door,
locked it and pocketed the key.</p>

<p>"What good does that do?" said Tootsie
disdainfully.</p>

<p>"You'll not leave this room until you swear
a solemn oath," said Skippy desperately.</p>

<p>"All right, I guess I can wait if you can,"
said Tootsie, settling down. "But I pity you
when Dad gets hold of you&mdash;thief!"</p>

<p>Skippy deliberated, resolved on anything
short of murder to stifle the threatening exposure.
Sterner methods were necessary. All at
once his eye spied a coil of rope in the corner
and he sprang to it with a shout.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said Tootsie
wrathfully.</p>

<p>"I am going to tie and gag and leave you
to starve," said Skippy, swinging a lasso.</p>

<p>There was a short and painful tussle in which
his necktie was torn to shreds and he surrendered
a certain amount of hair, but at the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of which, Miss Tootsie, tied hand and foot to
a chair, was propped up against a pillar, while
her conqueror proceeded to roll up his handkerchief
with the evident intention of applying
a gag.</p>

<p>"You'll like it when the rats come around,"
he said gloomily.</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! You can't scare me," said
Tootsie with alarming calm.</p>

<p>"And there are bats too, don't forget the
bats that get their claws in your hair," said
Skippy, approaching with the gag, "and not a
soul to hear your cries, you tattle-tale!"</p>

<p>"You'll get the licking of your life," said
Tootsie, looking at him steadily. "Thief!"</p>

<p>"So you won't name your price!" said
Skippy, passing behind her and holding the gag
before her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not if you murder me&mdash;you thief!"</p>

<p>Skippy again considered.</p>

<p>"She doesn't scare worth a darn," he acknowledged
to himself. Instead of applying
the gag he departed to the opposite side, sat
down and began to think. At the end of a long
moment he rose and approached her with a
brisk set manner.</p>

<p>"So you're going to tell, are you?"</p>

<p>"You just bet I'm going to tell, you coward!"</p>

<p>"All right, tell then!" He stooped, freed
her legs and arms and rose. "Tell if you've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
made up your mind to&mdash;but God help you if
you do. That's all I have to say."</p>

<p>"You can't scare me," said Tootsie, but already
intrigued by the new plan of action which
she divined behind her brother's silence.</p>

<p>"No, but there's some one I can scare!" said
Skippy, unlocking the door. "All right! War
to the knife, Miss Tootsie! Remember, though,
I warned you!"</p>

<p>"Who are you threatening now?" said Tootsie,
trying to conceal her anxiety; for long association
had engendered a lively respect for
the Skippy imagination.</p>

<p>"I never threaten," said Skippy disdainfully,
"but if that red-haired, knock-kneed, overfed
beau of yours ever sets foot on this place
again, he comes in a hearse! And what goes
for him, goes for all! Go on and tell, but you'll
have the loneliest summer you've ever had,
young lady!"</p>

<p>Five minutes later a treaty of peace was
concluded on the basis of secret understandings
secretly arrived at, and Miss Tootsie Bedelle
replaced the dressmaker's figure in the arms of
the triumphant diplomat while the phonograph
gave forth the strains of the Washington Post.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Tootsie's terpsichorean assistance was sorely
needed. Skippy was not a natural glider and
gliding as Tootsie explained to him was essential
in a ballroom, in polite society at least.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Skippy's feet could skip, hop and jump with
the best, but they were not, in any sense of the
word, gliders. The change from the inanimate
embrace of the dressmaker's form to Tootsie's
pliant figure, however, worked such miracles
that at the end of twenty minutes' industrious
application, Tootsie expressed herself as astonished
and delighted.</p>

<p>Now of course Skippy could have gone for
instruction to Dolly Travers, who was the object
of these secret efforts. But that was not
the Skippy way. He had always shunned any
exhibition of inferiority. Whatever was to be
learned he learned in privacy and exhibited in
public. He had taught himself to shoot marbles,
to solve the intricate sequences of mumblety
peg, to throw an out-curve, to pick up a double
hitch with one hand, to chin himself, skin the
cat and hang by his toes behind the safe seclusion
of the barn wall. Whatever his failures
they were not accompanied by the jeers of an
audience. He had gone off in secret to the
swimming pool by Bretton's creek and smarted
for hours under crashing belly-whoppers until
he had taught himself to dive forward and
backward. Then he watched with grinning
superiority the fate of less experienced youngsters
who followed his dare.</p>

<p>So in the present sentimental crisis. To rank
in the estimation of Miss Dolly Travers there
was no escaping the fact that he would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to surrender his prejudices and incline his feet
to the popular way. But having reached this
decision he determined to stage his effects. For
two more Saturdays he continued in dignified
isolation to escort Miss Travers to the weekly
hop and back, guarding her scarf and fan,
straining his mouth into the semblance of an
interested smile while other fellows slipped
their arms around the tiny figure and moved
dexterously or heavily about the ballroom.</p>

<p>On the third Saturday, halfway to the club
house, just as he had planned, Miss Dolly returned
to the point of discussion.</p>

<p>"Jack, aren't you ever, ever going to learn
to dance?"</p>

<p>"Oh well, perhaps some day," he said casually.</p>

<p>"But you can't go through life without dancing!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, of course not."</p>

<p>"Really I think it's just too selfish of you.
You know how I adore it. Why won't you try?
I do believe you're afraid of being laughed
at."</p>

<p>Skippy smiled craftily to himself.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I'll have a try."</p>

<p>"That's what you've said every time," said
Miss Dolly, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>Skippy bided his opportunity until the third
two-step had begun and the claimants for the
favorite's hand were congregating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sitting this out with Jack," said Dolly,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Say, a fossil who can't dance oughtn't to
have any rights around here, nohow," said
Happy Mather. "You're only a clothes horse
anyway, Skippy."</p>

<p>Dolly burst out laughing at this, which
pained Skippy exceedingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, any chump can dance if he wants to."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Easiest thing in the world if I wanted
to."</p>

<p>"Easy?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Just keeping in time, that's all."</p>

<p>"Here's a dollar you can't get three times
around the room."</p>

<p>Skippy pretended to hesitate.</p>

<p>"I'll pay another dollar any day to see a
circus," said Joe Crocker, beginning to smirk.</p>

<p>"Dolly, hold the money," said Skippy.</p>

<p>Miss Dolly looked up in some consternation
for the group now numbered a half a dozen and
the floor was vast and bare.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to wait a little?" she said
with a glance at Crocker, who was nudging his
neighbor.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said Skippy. "Now tell
me again what I do."</p>

<p>"Two steps with the left forward and then
two steps with the right. Hold my arm so,"
said Dolly a little breathlessly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on tight, Skippy," said Happy Mather.</p>

<p>"Step on your own feet."</p>

<p>"Balance on your heels."</p>

<p>"Don't let them rattle you, Jack."</p>

<p>"They can't. Which foot do I start on?"</p>

<p>"The left."</p>

<p>"Shall we give him a push, Dolly?" said
Lazelle sympathetically, while his companions,
linking arms, were beaming with anticipated
delight.</p>

<p>Skippy, having properly worked up his audience,
nodded to his partner and floated off in
a perfect dancing style.</p>

<p>"Jack, you wretch, you've danced for
years!" said Dolly after the first surprise had
passed. "You've just been making fun of me
all this time."</p>

<p>"Never been on a ballroom floor before in
my life," said Skippy, keeping within the letter
of the truth.</p>

<p>"Why you're wonderful, Jack! But then
how could you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's mental, everything is mental," said
Skippy conceitedly. "I just watched till I got
it in my mind and the rest was easy. Thanks
for the long green. Hello, what's become of
our little gallery of nuts?"</p>

<p>Whether or not Dolly was entirely convinced
by this casual explanation, the immediate return
to Skippy was enormous. Not only were
the claimants to her affections completely distanced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but Miss Dolly, for a time, adopted an
attitude of respect and deference towards him,
which had formerly been totally lacking.</p>

<p>Skippy was tremendously in love. There was
no doubt about that. You could see it in the
dishpan glow of his scrubbed forehead, in the
spotless flannels and the lily white hands. There
was something secure and permanent in the
attachment. Dolly was not sentimental and
only distantly affectionate, but she was absorbing.
There was no question of an eight-hour
day in his case. From nine <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> until Mr. Travers
ostentatiously began to bar the library
windows for the night, Mr. Skippy Bedelle was
at one end of a wire with Miss Dolly Travers
at the other, pushing the button.</p>

<p>That practical young lady, realizing that
Skippy's earning capacity was still woefully
limited, permitted no allusions to the distant
holy bonds of matrimony, but she did allow him
to mortgage his future to the extent of the promenade
and dances which would decorate his
scholastic and collegiate journey, as well as
attendance at all athletic contests of any nature
whatsoever. On his birthday (when the
sinking fund toward the first dress suit rose to
the colossal sum of fifty dollars) they solemnly
exchanged pins, Dolly openly sporting the red
and black of Lawrenceville, while Skippy concealed
in the secret recesses of his tie a little
gold wishbone which would lead him to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
higher prizes in life, add three inches to his
stature and the additional twenty pounds necessary
to qualify for the varsity.</p>

<p>His fall from grace was of course the subject
of great merriment among his companions,
particularly Happy Mather and Joe Crocker
in whom memory still rankled. A direct insult
was of course dangerous, but there were other
subtler ways. At least half a dozen times a day
some one was sure to ask him,</p>

<p>"I say, Skippy, what's doing to-night?"</p>

<p>"Got anything on this afternoon?"</p>

<p>But Skippy brushed aside their crude attempts
at persiflage with indifference. He had
won out. The courted prize was his. For two
weeks not a cloud obtruded on the clear sky of
his content. Dolly bullied and bossed him. He
did her errands. He fetched and carried. He
served her and no other goddess. And then
tragedy arrived with the arrival of the celebrated
Hickey Hicks, who came down to spend
a fortnight with the Triumphant Egghead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hickey in a Deadly R&ocirc;le</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>HICKEY, be it remembered, had just severed
his connections with the Lawrenceville
school after a display of pedagogical despotism
which had no parallel except in the case of the
celebrated Captain Dreyfus. Just because certain
disturbing incidents had occurred in close
succession, beginning with the theft of the clapper;
the disappearance of Tabby's bed, when
that inexperienced young master had dashed
two miles down the Trenton road in search of
fictitious burglars; the famous Fed and anti-Fed
riots when a misdirected effort to inculcate
the love of politics had almost resulted in a recourse
to the financial institution which insures
the school against destruction by fire or otherwise&mdash;the
head master, without an iota of
evidence (he acknowledged it frankly), had
requested the Hon. Hickey Hicks to seek a
wider field for the admittedly fertile powers
which were peculiarly his.</div>

<p>When Hickey with his resplendent social
manner cast the eye of favor on Dolly Travers,
after having remarked her unquestioned superiority
with the light fantastic toe, Skippy felt
exactly the way the Vicomte de Bragelonne did
when royalty appeared to claim the hand of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Louise de la Valli&egrave;re. Hickey was in the heavy
middleweight class while he was still a bantam.
Hickey was one of the princely figures of school
tradition. He came, he saw, he conquered. He
was an athlete, whose arrival was disputed by
the three leading colleges. Sambones Bedelle
himself, captain of next year's Yale varsity nine,
allowed himself to be seen publicly with his arm
resting affectionately over Hickey's shoulders.
With such a halo it was no wonder that Dolly
in her early teens should have yielded to the
flattery of his preference. Skippy acknowledged
so much to himself as he stood on the
fringe of the spectators and watched Dolly
with rapturous upturned face whirling about
the room in the arms of the great man.</p>

<p>"What ye doin' to-morrow afternoon,
Skippy?" said Puffy Ellis, who enjoyed the reversal
of r&ocirc;les.</p>

<p>"I'm cleaning up the mitts. Want to come
around?" said Skippy, with what is commonly
described as a steely look.</p>

<p>Puffy did not pursue the subject and the chip
on Skippy's shoulder remained unchallenged.</p>

<p>How Hickey danced! The days had not arrived
when acrobatic feats had invaded the
decorum of the ballroom, and such simple departures
from the routine as dos-&agrave;-dos and
single hand were enough to provoke envy and
astonishment.</p>

<p>Skippy forgot his irritation as he watched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the graceful guiding of his rival. Hickey certainly
could dance! He admitted it. Never
with or without the assistance of a dressmaker's
manikin could he ever hope to rival
him in this accomplishment. He went dutifully
to claim his turn with the faithless one. His
heart was acutely torn and he knew the peculiar
delight he was affording his numerous friends,
but he forced a smile of indifference. Besides,
in his fertile imagination he had the glimmerings
of a stratagem.</p>

<p>"I've saved the fifth two-step and the seventh
waltz for you," said Dolly, squeezing his arm
ever so lightly, "though you haven't asked
me yet."</p>

<p>The summer was long and she was quite
aware that in another ten days the resplendent
Mr. Hicks would pass as Shelley had passed.
Besides she secretly admired Skippy's sporting
manner in adversity.</p>

<p>"Awfully good of you," he said lightly,
"but see here, Dolly, don't bother about me.
Hickey's got us all skinned hollow when it
comes to this game. Go ahead, keep on dancing
with him. Go as far as you like."</p>

<p>"My, but he waltzes divinely!" said Dolly,
relieved.</p>

<p>"He's a wonder, all right, and a cracker-jack
at anything he touches! Sambones says
he'll make the varsity, certain next year."</p>

<p>"What happened about his leaving school?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"That&mdash;that was an outrage," said Skippy,
who would have scorned to attack a rival
meanly. "I'll tell you all about that."</p>

<p>"You're sure you don't mind my dancing so
much with him?" said Dolly, who had allowed
Hickey to cut in six dances running.</p>

<p>"I? Bless you, no!"</p>

<p>"It's just his wonderful dancing," said
Dolly, looking down.</p>

<p>"Don't blame you. He is A No. 1 with his
feet all right," said Skippy, and he added carelessly,
"wonderful how he manages it, too, with
his infirmity."</p>

<p>"His infirmity?" said Dolly, startled.</p>

<p>"Did I say infirmity?" said Skippy, pretending
surprise. "For heaven's sake, don't
tell any one. Gee, I shouldn't have said that."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what infirmity?" said Dolly, now
in a high state of excitement.</p>

<p>Skippy compressed his lips to show that they
were forever sealed, and moved away. But he
noted with satisfaction that the next time Miss
Dolly Travers passed whirling about the great
man, instead of the rapturous upturned gaze,
was one of alarmed curiosity.</p>

<p>The next day at the beach Dolly opened up at
once the question of infirmities.</p>

<p>"Dolly," said Skippy firmly, "I'm not going
to say any more, so it's no use trying to pump
me. I'm ashamed to have said what I did. A
feller can't help what he's got, or what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
hasn't got, can he? And it's only a foolish
prejudice after all."</p>

<p>"But Jack&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was another fellow at school," said
Skippy, without attention, "who had a glass
eye, but he was a positive nuisance. He used
to take it out and leave it around. No one could
stand roomin' with him. It certainly gave you
the creeps to be lookin' on the table for a collar
button or a pen and find&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Dolly gave a shriek and fled with
her hands over her ears.</p>

<p>Now Skippy had made no direct insinuation
(he always had the greatest respect for the
letter of the truth), but it is a fact that when
forty-eight hours later the Mathers gave a
dance, Hickey became suddenly aware of a
complete change of attitude among the feminine
portion of his admirers.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is wrong with me, anyhow?"
he said after the second dance. He went
outside and scrupulously examined himself in
the mirror. Then he went back and tried another
partner. Again the strange feeling stole
over him. Every time he brought the battery
of his blue eyes to bear upon his partner her
eyes turned uneasily away and the moment his
own glance was averted, back hers came, in an
uncanny fixed interrogation. The night was a
triumph for Skippy, who danced eight times
with Miss Dolly Travers and had the further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
satisfaction of observing her in a state of
nerves after each of the two which she begrudged
to Mr. Hicks.</p>

<p>But alas for Skippy and his short moment of
triumph! Within twenty-four hours the mystified
Hickey had discovered the truth and Hickey
was one that was never lightly challenged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sitting It Out</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>SKIPPY, fatuously unconscious of any overtaking
fate, escorted Dolly to the next Saturday
night hop. On Monday Mr. Hickey Hicks
would be on his way to new pastures and life
would return to simpler terms. Dolly, however,
was in no amiable frame of mind.</div>

<p>"You said he had a glass eye. You know you
did," she said for the tenth time.</p>

<p>"Now that's just like a woman," thought
Skippy, justly offended, and out loud he said,
with some asperity, "<i>You</i> said so. I never
did."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Sure, you did! Why you said it was the
left one."</p>

<p>"Well, you let me think so anyway."</p>

<p>"How was I to know?" said Skippy, illogically.
"Perhaps he has a glass eye. Have you
asked him?"</p>

<p>They reached the club house and as the orchestra
was already industriously at work,
Skippy said playfully,</p>

<p>"All's fair in love and war anyhow! S'pose
we dance."</p>

<p>"You don't deserve it," said Dolly, hesitating.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
She glanced around and as no one else
was an immediate prospect, she accorded him
her arm. Skippy began to perceive that the
burden of conversation would lie with him.</p>

<p>The next dance was a waltz and they waited,
the one expectantly, the other in resignation for
the usual rush of the stags which invariably
accompanied Miss Dolly's conquering arrival.
As she was endowed with a lively sense of
humor, her irritation had quite departed and
Skippy was as blissfully happy in his restoration
to favor as the four-footed puppy when
reconciliation with the master has followed
chastisement. To keep fidelity with human
nature, it must likewise be recorded that the
practical sense was likewise strong in the young
lady, who was fully aware of the value of a bird
in the hand to one about to fly the bush. Hickey
appeared and came directly towards them.
Skippy fell back.</p>

<p>"Hello, Skippy, old top," said Hickey, with
accented cordiality. He shook hands with Miss
Dolly, who greeted him with the most encouraging
of smiles. He complimented her on the bewitching
gown which made her prettier than
ever, wondered where she had been all this time,
shook hands effusively&mdash;and passed on. Miss
Dolly bit her lip and took hasty survey of the
room. The old reliables were all actively engaged,
spinning about the room with other
partners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I adore this tune," she said suddenly.
"Come on, let's waltz."</p>

<p>Then, just to show her independence, she
suggested that the next dance, a polka, was a
dreadful bore and Skippy, still unsuspicious,
bore her away in great delight to the shadowy
intimacies of the veranda. Miss Dolly was a
little quicker in her perceptions. She saw
what was up, and being of high spirit, decided
to answer in kind. She returned to the floor
and danced a third time with Skippy, who was
too fatuously pleased with his good fortune
to notice the suppressed hilarity in the room.</p>

<p>"Let's sit here," said Dolly, selecting the
most public spot. When Happy Mather and
Crocker and Lazelle and the superior Mr. Hicks
did arrive, she would have her revenge. She
would refuse flatly. She would dance with
Skippy openly and defiantly the whole evening.
The only drawback was that no one came.</p>

<p>They sat out two dances and then a feeling
of panic descended upon them. They were
horribly, glaringly conspicuous. Every eye
was on them. Every one was whispering at
their expense. Dolly had never known the sensation
of being a wallflower, and for the first
time her natural wit deserted her. At first she
had deployed all the instinctive arts of her
challenged coquetry. She had openly flaunted
her affection for Skippy, smiling into his fascinated
eyes, laughing uproariously at the inanities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he had to offer. Then her spirits
suddenly evaporated and she listened with a
cold creepy feeling in her back, while Skippy,
in desperation for a topic of conversation, began
to explain the intricacies of Mosquito-Proof
Socks, to perfecting which his life henceforth
would be devoted.</p>

<p>"Let's dance."</p>

<p>Skippy, halfway in his exposition of the
commercial value of an invention which would
appeal to twice ninety million legs at six pair
of socks a year, flushed and rose heavily. The
light had dawned upon him at last. They were
being put in coventry and the diabolical mind
that was thus taking its fiendish revenge could
be none other than the man he had wronged&mdash;Hickey
Hicks.</p>

<p>From now on it was torture, pure, unadulterated,
exquisite torture, such as only the self-conscious
stripling of the first sixteen awkward
years can experience. To save his life he could
not think of a thing to say, while in his arms
Dolly grew heavier and heavier. His arm
ached, his feet began to stumble, he bumped
into other couples.</p>

<p>After he had sat out the eighth dance in
fitful silence, he began to experience the
strangest antipathy for Miss Dolly Travers,
who but an hour before had been the rapturous
ending of all his day dreams. Let no cynic
here exclaim, with facile wit, that romance ends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
thus in the compulsory quality of marriage.
We make no such allusions. We only state
that Skippy, in his inexperience, began morally
to disintegrate. The more he was forced to
sit, chained by convention, the object of public
hilarity, the more he wondered at his
former infatuation. Dolly disputed by every
male was a figment of the imagination&mdash;how
different was the reality! Mimi Lafontaine
was a hundred times more desirable and at least
had <i>something</i> to say! The situation was hideous,
but how escape? If only he could get to
Hickey and buy him off! But he couldn't get
to his tormentor, that was the trouble! Then
suddenly an idea came to him. In his pocket
was the roll of bills that comprised the sinking
fund for his dress suit. Carefully and unnoticed
by Dolly, he extracted a two dollar bill.
When next he danced, he danced with the bill
openly flaunted behind the all-unconscious
Dolly, openly offering it to whoever would come
to his rescue. Still the banded traitors smirked
and remained loyal to their leader&mdash;they, too,
had scores to settle!</p>

<p>"Get me a glass of lemonade, won't you,
Jack, like a dear?" said Dolly, who had thought
of a possible opening.</p>

<p>Skippy went and took a full five minutes
until he had made quite sure the next dance
was under way. To his horror Dolly was
where he had left her&mdash;sitting alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>When the tenth dance had begun, he hesitated
no longer. He replaced the two dollar
bill by one of the next denomination, and with
the V carefully exposed, he managed to bump
into Hickey and draw his attention to the
price of his liberty. Hickey appeared interested
but only half convinced. Skippy held
out another dance and then, groaning inwardly,
increased the bait to ten.</p>

<p>Whereupon Hickey condescended. The signal
was given and Skippy, standing aloof and
humble in the shadows of the veranda, perceived
through the window Miss Dolly Travers,
as the stags swarmed down, resume her sway
as the queen of the ball.</p>

<p>On Monday Hickey departed in a burst of
glory. With him something else departed&mdash;a
great romance. Illusions are fragile things
and when they are shattered the pieces are
too small to be reassembled. <i>Sic transit</i> Dolly
Travers!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dead Game Sports</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>AT the end of August, Mr. Skippy Bedelle
met Mr. Snorky Green on the Fall River
Boat, each being in complete agreement as to
the economic superiority of the water route to
the great metropolis, when the end in view was
the acquisition of that radiant apotheosis of
perfect manhood, the first dress suit.</div>

<p>"Gee Whilikins, Skippy, you're enormous,"
said Snorky, measuring him with his eye.
"How did you do it? I've only gained half
an inch."</p>

<p>"I'm twelve pounds heavier," said Skippy
proudly. "Feel that."</p>

<p>"Hard as nails!" said Snorky, pinching the
proffered biceps. "You do look different, too."</p>

<p>Skippy, thinking on Dolly Travers, blushed.</p>

<p>"Got to shave every other day now," he said
hastily, to cover his confusion.</p>

<p>"Have a coffin nail?" said Snorky, feeling
that a bold stroke was necessary to restore the
balance.</p>

<p>"Dyin' for one," said Skippy, who disliked
the practice cordially. He selected a cigarette,
tapped it on his hand and rolled the rim on the
tip of his tongue. "Not bad."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nice bouquet, eh?" said Snorky, who had
listened in.</p>

<p>"What? You betcha! What's the monogram?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben. I swiped them," said Snorky,
who was returning from a family visit. "Suppose
we give the old tub the once over and
see if there's anything worth looking at on
board."</p>

<p>Skippy allowed the cigarette to hang pendant
from his lower lip, tilted his Panama with the
purple and white band, sank his hands in his
pockets and imitated carefully the dead game
sporting slouch of his companion as they proceeded
on their critical inspection of the feminine
offering on the decks.</p>

<p>"Rum bunch," said Snorky, who was putting
it on for Skippy. "Little girl over there got
nice eyes."</p>

<p>"Piano legs."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Piano legs. Big as a porpoise in five
years," said Skippy, putting it on for Snorky.</p>

<p>"I daresay," said Snorky, who continued his
efforts to impress his chum by staring down a
large buxom lady who happened to glance their
way. "Rather good-looking, the old fighting
brunette over there."</p>

<p>"Seemed interested in you."</p>

<p>"Yes, rather," said Snorky, turning for a
fatuous backward glance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's this?" said Skippy, suddenly interested.</p>

<p>Ahead by the rail two young girls were
watching curiously the vanishing outlines of
the harbor.</p>

<p>"That's class," said Snorky instantly.</p>

<p>"You betcha!" said Skippy, noting the large
leghorn hats dripping with rosebuds, the trim
ruffled organdie dresses and the twin parasols,
pink and mauve. The young ladies looked up
curiously at their swaggering approach and
then away. Skippy in his assiduous pursuit
of fiction of the romantic tinge had often read
of "velvety" eyes and pondered incredulously.
For the first time in his life, suddenly, in the
hazards of a crowded steamer, a young girl
of irreproachable manners had looked at him
and the eyes were undeniably "velvety." It
troubled him. Not that he was susceptible to
such a point, but it stirred memories of ancient
readings into the night on soft window seats,
or under green trees in the troubling warmth
of spring days.</p>

<p>"The blonde for mine," said Snorky pompously.</p>

<p>"I didn't see her," said Skippy dreamily.</p>

<p>They linked arms and passed in the rakish,
indolent manner of thorough men of the world
who know that but to be seen is to conquer.
To their discomfiture the young ladies failed to
notice the extreme distinction of their manly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
appearance and shortly afterward left the
deck.</p>

<p>"We failed to impress," said Skippy disconsolately.</p>

<p>"A lot you know about women."</p>

<p>"They never saw us."</p>

<p>"Huh! Betcha they were sneaking looks
at us every time we passed. Just you wait.
They'll be out in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"What'll we do?"</p>

<p>"Pretend we're not interested."</p>

<p>They stalked the deck ten times with a nonchalant,
bored air, but slightly roving eyes.</p>

<p>"They're waiting inside," said Snorky
obstinately.</p>

<p>"Well, you go and scout. I'll wait here,"
said Skippy, whose interest was only a determination
not to be outshone by his chum of
chums.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Snorky was back, all excitement.</p>

<p>"Just as I told you. They're in the front
saloon playing cards. Come on."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said Skippy,
hesitating.</p>

<p>Snorky thought a moment.</p>

<p>"We've got to put over something big."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>Snorky thought again.</p>

<p>"We must make 'em think we're high rollers;&mdash;yachts,
race horses, and all that."</p>

<p>"Well, how?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Snorky thought a third time.</p>

<p>"How much money have you got?" said
Skippy suddenly.</p>

<p>"In cash?"</p>

<p>"Sure. On you."</p>

<p>"About forty-three dollars," said Snorky,
who from time to time had been feeling with
his fingers to assure himself that no pickpocket
had outwitted him.</p>

<p>"Fork it out. I've got an idea."</p>

<p>"Is it all right?" said Snorky, who had reason
to dread the Skippy imagination.</p>

<p>"Fine and dandy. Don't worry. Trust me.
Show 'em up."</p>

<p>Snorky produced a twenty, two tens and
three common-a-garden ones.</p>

<p>"You keep a twenty and you stick it on top.
Then you change the two tens into ones and
that makes some whopping wad, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Say, I don't get&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said Skippy, who led the
way to the cigar counter.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Skippy Bedelle and
Mr. Snorky Green, with large banded cigars,
entered the ladies' saloon and carelessly installed
themselves at a table next but one to
that occupied by the young girls.</p>

<p>"Well, old sport," said Snorky, twirling the
mercifully unsmoked cigar in his fingers. "Suppose
we go over our accounts?"</p>

<p>"Always be businesslike," said Skippy, poising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a pencil over a sheet of paper with plutocratic
nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Owe you thirty-five plunks for last night's
poker game," said Snorky, raising his voice
sufficiently.</p>

<p>"That's right, and I owe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, me first."</p>

<p>Snorky dug into his trousers and came up
with a roll of greenbacks that made the colored
porter who happened to be passing stumble in
his step.</p>

<p>"Twenty and ten and five, makes thirty-five,"
he said, peeling them off with a nimble
exhibition of legerdemain which kept the lower
bills well concealed.</p>

<p>"Keerect," said Skippy, sweeping them towards
him with a languidly indifferent air.</p>

<p>"Then I borrowed a ten spot to tip the head
waiter. Remember?"</p>

<p>"I do remember."</p>

<p>"Five and five. Correct?"</p>

<p>"Keerect."</p>

<p>"How do we stand on the ponies?"</p>

<p>"Only fair," said Skippy. "We lost two and
won one. I couldn't get our money up on the
others."</p>

<p>"Let's see. It was twenty-five bones each,
wasn't it?" said Snorky, jogging his elbow,
to notify him that the impression they were
making was simply stupendous.</p>

<p>"Right again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"That sets me back fifty plunks. That's
easy. Here you are, one, two, three, four, five
tens. Correct?"</p>

<p>"Keerect," said Skippy, brushing in the
greenbacks, with the same casual motion of his
hand.</p>

<p>"That squares me."</p>

<p>"It does."</p>

<p>"Now what's coming back?"</p>

<p>Skippy in turn, after certain struggles with
his trousers pocket, brought forth a bundle
which could have done credit to a cattle king
and said, as he slipped the elastic,</p>

<p>"Twenty-five at five to one is just about one
hundred and twenty-five."</p>

<p>"That's all right, but how about the tip to
Spike Murphy?"</p>

<p>"Spike Murphy?" said Skippy, looking at
him hard.</p>

<p>"The fellow who put us wise."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Skippy, recovering
a proper sporting manner. "Forget that.
I cleaned up enough to handle a little thing
like that."</p>

<p>"Lucky dog!"</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty-five," said Skippy,
going through the proper motions. "Twenty
once, twice, three times, four and five. One
hundred, and ten and twenty and twenty&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this moment, whether by chance, by
intent or by the emotion caused by the display<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of such wealth, there was a crash from the
nearby table and two magazines fell to the
floor. Snorky, ever alert, sprang to his feet,
retrieved the magazines and offered them to the
blondest of the two with punctilious courtesy.</p>

<p>"Allow me. I believe these belong to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh thank you," said the young lady, looking
quite distressed.</p>

<p>"Awfully warm night, isn't it?" said Snorky,
whose heart was pumping at his own unexampled
audacity.</p>

<p>"Sir, I do not think I have been introduced
to you," said the young lady, stiffening and
looking what to Snorky, at least, were daggers.</p>

<p>He uttered several unintelligible sounds,
flushed a fiery red and backed away.</p>

<p>"Right where the chicken met the axe," said
Skippy, who began to whistle a melancholy tune
as he gathered up the scattered greenbacks.
"Here comes mother."</p>

<p>"Let's beat it," said Snorky, who felt a
sudden need for a purer atmosphere.</p>

<p>"You know women better than I do," said
Skippy, who though a chum was human.</p>

<p>"Damn them all," said Snorky, peering over
the railing into the night and exposing his forehead
to the cooling breeze. "But why the devil
did she lead me on?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments in a Dress Suit</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>WHEN they descended at the Southampton
station the family coach was in waiting.
They surrendered their valises to the footman
while each clung tightly to a large square paper
box, carefully protected and corded.</div>

<p>"Gee, it'll just about knock the wind out of
old Caroline," said Snorky in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't they suspect?" said Skippy nervously.</p>

<p>"Not for a minute. Say, I'd never have the
nerve to sport it alone."</p>

<p>"Have you got the box with the shirt studs
in?" said Skippy fidgeting.</p>

<p>"Why I handed it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's so. They're here," said Skippy,
after a dip into four pockets.</p>

<p>At the thought that at last after sixteen long
and eventful years the supreme moment had
come when he would step out of the shell of
adolescence and greet the waiting world in his
first forty-dollar, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'customs'">custom</ins>-made dress suit, in
high collar, white stiff bosom, two tails pendant,
Skippy shivered slightly and drew a deep, delightfully
terrified breath.</p>

<p>"We'll put it over all right," he said loudly,
and he began to whistle as is the instinct of
boyhood, whether facing the possibility of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
parental caning; screwing up courage to ring
her doorbell; or turning a gloomy corner in the
moonlight where something horrid and shapeless
may be lurking.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, as he was solicitously
examining the crease in the soft lovely black
trousers, after hanging the swallow-tailed coat
over a padded hanger, Snorky came in with a
face of thunder.</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>do</i> you think?" he said nervously.</p>

<p>"They forgot to put in the pants," said
Skippy, leaping to the worst.</p>

<p>"Shucks, no. There's a party on to-night."</p>

<p>"A party?"</p>

<p>"There'll be millions of people to dinner and
a dance after."</p>

<p>"What of it?" said Skippy loudly, though the
chill began to ascend from his feet.</p>

<p>"My Lord&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, you're not losing your nerve, you
chicken-hearted rabbit, are you?" said Skippy,
who was now absolutely terrified.</p>

<p>"You mean you're game?"</p>

<p>"Snorky! I wouldn't have believed it of
you!"</p>

<p>"Say, it isn't your family or your sister,"
said Snorky angrily. "My aunt's cat's pants,
how they'll howl!"</p>

<p>Skippy prepared for the great event by what
would have sufficed for a European semi-annual
immersion and, emerging spotless and stainless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from the bath, with his derby closely
pressed over the niceties of his parted hair,
perceived that he had still forty-two minutes
left of the hour and a half he had allotted to
this supreme toilette.</p>

<p>"My Lord, I hope I've got everything," he
said, standing in diaphanous contemplation.
The one thing that worried him a little was the
studs. They had looked over twenty different
varieties, flat ones and solid gold ones, spirals,
encrusted studs, and studs that anchored with
a queer twist. Finally they had allowed themselves
to be persuaded by a flashy clerk and
settled on a patent imitation pearl stud that
pushed in and stuck, simplest thing in the
world, like the click of a spring lock; that would
leave the beautiful creamy white expanse of
shirt absolutely unruffled by any preliminary
struggle.</p>

<p>"Shall I try 'em on first?" he thought, glancing
down at the immaculate bosom. But at this
moment a voice behind him cried pompously.</p>

<p>"Old top. Cast your eye on this."</p>

<p>Skippy gazed and his courage rose. His
private opinion was that Snorky looked like a
French butcher going to a morning wedding in
hired regalia.</p>

<p>"The suit's a lalapazooza!" he said carefully.</p>

<p>"It'll kill old Carrots," said Snorky, who
thus referred to his sister. "She's over the
age limit now but when I pull this she'll look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a grandmother! Say, look me over. Make sure
there are no tags or price marks. All right?"</p>

<p>"Jim dandy."</p>

<p>He went two steps to the door and turned.</p>

<p>"Say, remember one thing. Keep your fists
out of your trousers pockets, Bo. That's important."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Ignoramus," said Skippy, reproachfully.
"That'll give the whole game away. You never
stick your hands in your trousers pockets unless
you're a greenhorn."</p>

<p>"How do the shirt studs work?" said Skippy,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Simplest things in the world."</p>

<p>"Say, Snorky?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"These coat tails have got pockets in them."</p>

<p>"Sure they have, you chump! They're to
hide your mawlers in."</p>

<p>"Don't be so bright," said Skippy indignantly.
"But what <i>do</i> we put into them, then?"</p>

<p>"Handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Rats. I know better than that. You stick
a handkerchief up in front and pull out just the
tip of it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's for a toothbrush if you're
staying over night."</p>

<p>"No, but honest, what do you put in them?"
said Skippy, who did not wish to miss a trick.</p>

<p>They thought this over a long moment, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
then gave it up as greater intelligences, pondering
on the mysteries of existence, have given
it up.</p>

<p>"Well, ta-ta. See you below."</p>

<p>"Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to break in the family one by
one," said Snorky, wagging his head. "Lettin'
'em get over the shock. I'm taking no
chances."</p>

<p>Left to himself, Skippy hastened to his own
preparations. At the risk of being acclaimed
a traitor to the sex, we must record here the
truth, that with five mirrors surrounding him
and one in the bathroom, it took Skippy exactly
forty-five minutes to perfect his toilette from
every angle of observation. First he burrowed
into his shirt which deranged the part in his
hair and necessitated another period of readjustment.
Then he put on his trousers and adjusted
the suspenders until each trouser leg
hung with the crease untroubled and just
clear of the boot. But having done this he discovered,
as others have discovered, that patent
shirt-studs sported in an unaccustomed place,
require the fullest play of the arms. The placing
of the studs was of itself the most delicate
of operations and twice he went down on his
knees and halfway under the bed to retrieve
the upper one which popped out just as he
thought he had it securely imprisoned. Once
more he adjusted the suspenders, and began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
work on the stiff collar which caught his throat
and forced up his chin. After five minutes'
struggle he succeeded in fastening this with the
aid of a buttonhook, and suddenly the thing he
had feared was upon him. He had forgotten,
completely forgotten, the white tie!</p>

<p>What was he to do? Snorky was beyond the
reach of assistance. Twice he had heard shouts
of uproarious delight down the hall marking
his chum's progress in breaking in the family.
The house was huge and Snorky by this time
was down on the second floor or even practicing
in the parlor. He went through the motions of
searching through his valise but he knew all
the while that it was futile. He had forgotten
the final touch, the <i>sine qua non</i> of fashion!</p>

<p>He found a wrapper in the hall closet and
opening the door cautiously peered into the
hall. An uncle and an older brother of Snorky's
were on the same floor, but he had not been
introduced and his courage failed him. He
returned to his room and contemplated the
white bed spread, the pillow slips and the
muslin curtains in a wild hope that something
might lend itself to an improvisation. Then he
shook his head mournfully. There was only
one way out. To appear properly dressed in
this, a strange house, before strangers, he
would have to commit a crime! The only way
to get a white tie was to steal one. At this
moment while his whole moral future turned on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
an impulse, a door down the hall opened and
Skippy, peering forth, beheld an elderly gentleman,
immaculately dressed, descend the stairs.
For a short moment he hesitated but atavism
and necessity were against him. He stole out
into the hall and made his way on tiptoe. All
at once he heard a step ascending the stairs. A
bathroom door was open. He sprang into it
with a thumping heart and waited breathlessly,
leaning limply against the wall. All at once his
eye fell on the clothes basket. From the top
a crumpled white tie was hanging. He was
saved!</p>

<p>He seized the tie and head erect, honor intact,
walked fearlessly back to his room. But
there, a new dilemma! The tie was indeed of
whitest lawn but, alas! across one end was a
smudge which defied the most persistent rubbing.
Skippy, as has been observed, was at the
period when the imagination is not confined by
tradition. In desperation he resorted to the
washbasin and with the aid of a brush, triumphantly
banished the damned spot. Then
having wrung the limp mass, he spread the
tie carefully against the window pane and
covering it with a handkerchief, laboriously
ironed it out with a shoe.</p>

<p>Just as the clock struck half past seven, Mr.
John C. Bedelle descended the last stairs and
greeted a critical world. Beads of perspiration
stood on his forehead, his spine seemed made of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
rubber, his knees shook and his restless, chilly
hands loomed before him, homeless and lost;
but he was safe at last in all the intricacies of
a dress suit&mdash;a man of fashion among men of
the world!</p>

<p>Snorky was standing miserably by the fireplace,
his large peppermint ears flanking a
heated face, as he defiantly faced the family
hilarity. Then Skippy's superb aplomb failed
him. Just beyond the smirking family, among
the early guests, was Miss Jennie Tupper, the
girl with the velvety eyes, and at her side, as
icily correct as when the night before she had
crushed Snorky's floundering attempt at lady-killing,
her sister Margarita.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shirt Studs as Cupid's Messenger</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>AFTER the room had returned to place
Skippy rallied, took the introductions
with preternatural stiffness, and gravitated to
Snorky. The white shirt front in the most
unaccountable manner had swollen to alarming
dimensions, the coat tails must be dragging
on the floor. His collar cut under his imprisoned
neck and his large white hands, longing
for sheltering pockets, seemed to float before
him like inflated balloons. If his were
complete manhood,&mdash;oh for a soft shirt and a
turned down collar!</div>

<p>"Kill it," said Snorky under his breath.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Kill that flag of liberty, you chump!" said
Snorky, glowering at the flaming edge of the
silk bandana handkerchief which Skippy was
sporting at his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with that? Every one does
it."</p>

<p>"Wrong! Look around you."</p>

<p>Skippy did so and surreptitiously extinguished
the bandana.</p>

<p>"Holy Mike, we're in for it," said Snorky.
"Do you know who they are?"</p>

<p>"The girls?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daughters of the Presbyterian minister,
strict as nails&mdash;Sunday school and mission
stuff. Oh Lord!"</p>

<p>"Pretend you knew it all along."</p>

<p>"And that other stuff? The dead game
sporting life?"</p>

<p>"Stick to your guns!" said Skippy desperately.</p>

<p>The next moment he was at table, between
Miss Caroline Bedelle and the blonde Margarita,
while across the table the soft velvety eyes
of Jennie looked at him sadly and reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Jack," said Snorky's sister,
staring at him. "I never, never would have
known you. You've gained twenty pounds."</p>

<p>"It's the shirt," thought Skippy, glancing
down at the bulging front that gave him the
torso of a wrestler. Then he began to wonder
which was the owner of the still slightly moist
tie. But soon all discomforts, even the intricate
maze of forks and knives, were forgotten before
the alarming problem of the shirt front.
When he sat upright, stiff as a ramrod, it was
relatively quiescent, but the moment he relaxed
or bent forward to eat it bulged forth as though
working on a spring, until a lurking horror that
it would escape altogether began to possess
him. He crept forward on his chair and balanced
on the edge, trying to mitigate the conspicuous
rigidity of his pose by a nonchalant
coquetting with the salt <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'celler'">cellar</ins>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose I must talk to you, for appearances'
sake," said the blonde Miss Tupper.</p>

<p>"Why so?" said Skippy haughtily, for having
just reacted from blondes, blondes did not
appeal to him.</p>

<p>"You ask?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I ask, and I think an apology is
due my friend and myself," said Skippy from
his great fund of literary conversations.</p>

<p>"Well, I like that!"</p>

<p>"You cut us dead twice on the deck and then
pretended not to know Arthur when he started
to speak to you," said Skippy icily.</p>

<p>Miss Margarita Tupper looked at him with
the intuitive suspicion of the righteous.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it," she said.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is adding insult to injury," said
Skippy, still in the best fictional manner. "Pardon
me if I do not pursue this conversation any
longer."</p>

<p>"I guess that'll hold the old girl," he said,
chuckling inwardly. But alas for such vanities,
or was it the unseen moral guardians which
may be expected to watch over the daughters of
the upright! The sudden shift of his indignant
body was attended with fatal results.</p>

<p>There was a distinct "pop." The upper
patent shirt-stud shot out, tinkled against a
vase and rolled directly towards the girl with
the velvety eyes.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Caroline, startled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some one threw a pebble against the window
pane," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Something cracked."</p>

<p>They are wrong, eternally wrong, who look
upon youth as a period of careless joy on the
threshold of manhood's struggles and sorrows!
Never in after-life would Skippy Bedelle experience
such a blank, helpless horror as in
that awful moment, when he sat overcome with
shame and confusion, awaiting detection. What
in heaven's name was he to say when the eyes
of the whole company would inevitably be directed
to the telltale stud, blazing now at the
plate of Miss Tupper? What did any one say,
anyhow, when a shirt stud popped across the
table? Nothing in his experience or the experience
of all the novelists in the world could
supply a clue. Wave after wave of red and
redder confusion rippled up from his collar and
surged to the roots of his hair. Should he
brazen it out? Should he make a light answer,
or was it etiquette to apologize humbly to his
hostess? How could he tell? If he were discovered
there was only one thing to do, to run
for it, to retreat to his room, lock his door, escape
by the window and leave by the night train,
disgraced and branded forever!</p>

<p>"Very funny," said Mrs. Bedelle. "Caroline,
look at the Bohemian glass vase. I'm
sure I heard it crack."</p>

<p>All glances immediately concentrated on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fatal area. Detection was now but a question
of instants. Then Skippy in the throes of
despair saw the plump little hand of Miss
Jennie Tupper reach out and casually close over
the offending pearl stud. He was saved, saved
by the miracle of compassion and forgiveness
that lifts women to those sublime heights where
mere men cannot attain!</p>

<p>Tears threatened his eyes, his throat swelled
up and slowly subsided. He looked over into the
velvety eyes and sent a message of abject
gratitude. He was her slave from now on,
irrevocably bound, faithful until death!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"You didn't detherve it," said Miss Jennie
an hour later when in the seclusion of the
veranda she had restored to him the unspeakable
stud.</p>

<p>"You're an angel," said Skippy hoarsely.
"I'll never, never forget that. That was white
of you, awfully white!"</p>

<p>"You didn't detherve it," repeated Miss
Tupper with as much severity as can accompany
the slightest of lisps and the eyes of a
gazelle.</p>

<p>"Don't be hard on a fellow," said Skippy
miserably.</p>

<p>"It was outwageous. You know, you didn't
know us."</p>

<p>How was he to lie to his saviour and benefactor
and yet how betray a chum?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"It did look bad," he said, momentarily at
loss, "but honest, now, Snorky's intentions
were nothing but honorable. Honest they
were."</p>

<p>"I with I could believe it," said Miss Jennie
sadly.</p>

<p>"I say, you must think I'm an awful rum
sort," said Skippy, on whom the velvety eyes
against the distant moon ripple on the water
and the nearby night fragrance of the honeysuckle
was beginning to work its charm.
"Well, I suppose I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no."</p>

<p>"A rotten good-for-nothing lot," said Skippy
gloomily, falling easily into the new part and
surprised to find what peculiar pleasure could
be extracted from the r&ocirc;le of the wayward.</p>

<p>"No, no, you're not that bad," said Miss
Jennie earnestly, "but I do think&mdash;well you've
not been under the withest of influenthes, have
you?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had a chance," said Skippy desperately.
"Everything has been against me.
Guess no one cares what becomes of me."</p>

<p>"I know," said the gentle voice. "It ith
hard."</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss Tupper," said Skippy, beginning
to be convinced of his own predestination
for the gallows, as he instinctively felt the
sentimental value of the r&ocirc;le. "Men like myself
don't get a chance to know women like you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
I wish to heaven&mdash;" He stopped, a lump in
his throat, and gazed into the sentimental night.
Great heavens, what a depraved character he
really was! For the first time he saw himself
in the enormity of his sinning. It was not only
the cigarettes and the one black cigar, purloined
from his father, but the orgies at penny-ante,
the occasional game of craps back of Mather's
barn. Then he remembered other damning
episodes in his black record&mdash;the time he had
gone into a mathematics exam and read the
formulas from Buster Bean's collar; the night
he had helped Sport McGinnis smuggle a bottle
of beer in for a welsh rabbit and swallowed a
full third of the rank stuff. Then there was an
appalling record of evasions, turnings and
twistings of the exact and literal truth&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can't be altogether bad if you're so
honeth," said Miss Jennie, in whom the instinct
was lively to bring the sinner home.</p>

<p>"I am. I am," said Skippy lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Can't I help&mdash;juth a little?"</p>

<p>"Would you, would you really?" he said
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Let me&mdash;pleath."</p>

<p>The plump little fingers came forth and met
the rough hand of the sinner. Skippy squeezed
them convulsively, not daring to trust his voice,
nodded twice and smiled bravely back in the
moonlight to show that the leaven of higher
things was already beginning to work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"How'd you get on with Margarita?" he
asked Snorky when they retired for the night.</p>

<p>"Margarita's a pippin!" said Snorky.</p>

<p>"I squared you all right."</p>

<p>"You bet you did! She came right up and
fed out of my hand. But, say, they swallowed
it all right."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The dead game sporting life stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Got a cig?"</p>

<p>"What? Oh yes. Get you one in a jiffy.
But say. Go easy. The governor and all that
sort of thing, you know."</p>

<p>"Nerves sort of jumpy to-night," said
Skippy languidly. "Need a few whiffs to quiet
'em down."</p>

<p>It was something new in his life, a good influence.
All his better nature rose up in response.
So summoning up his courage, he lit
a cigarette and tried to inhale&mdash;a desperate
character, worthy to be saved, certainly ought
to inhale! It was nauseating. It stung his
lungs and set his head to reeling. He left the
window and crawled over to the bed where he
lay weak but unconquered.</p>

<p>"By jinks, I will inhale, I'll inhale to-morrow!"
he said, seeing always the uplifting
smile and the pure velvety eyes of Miss Jennie
as the room waltzed around him. "It's going
to be awfully hard living up to her, but I'll do
it if it kills me!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Living Up to an Angel</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>SKIPPY woke with a blood curdling shriek
and landed sprawling in the middle of the
floor, his legs caught in the sheets, his head
smothered in the comforter, a convulsive grip
on the bolster, which he was desperately trying
to stifle when Snorky flung himself out of bed
and rushed to the rescue.</div>

<p>"Hold him back. Help Snorky! Hold him!"</p>

<p>"Hold what, who?" said Snorky, pursuing
the smothered figure of Skippy, who was still
wrestling with the bolster. "Wake up. It's
me! It's Snorky."</p>

<p>Skippy's grip relaxed and presently his
terror-stricken eyes emerged from the comforter.</p>

<p>"Holy Maria! In another minute he'd have
had me in the electric chair," he said, wiping
the clammy perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>"Nightmare eh?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! Gee! Moses!"</p>

<p>"Too much cigarette."</p>

<p>"Golly, what a life I've been leading!" said
Skippy, referring to the dream. "Bar rooms
and gambling dens, dark lanterns, hold-ups,
racetracks and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wake up, wake up!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all in the dream," said Skippy sulkily.
Then he remembered that all through the
hideous phantasmagoria, in the smoky mists of
low gambling dens, in the drizzle of midnight
conclaves, across the sepulchral silences of
leaden prisons, there had flitted the beatific
vision of an angel with velvety eyes and the
softest of lisps.</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said Snorky.</p>

<p>"Can't remember any more," said Skippy.
Her name must be shielded at every cost.</p>

<p>He had determined to be a lost character, a
wayward son, a gentleman sport, with nerves
of steel. The sentimental values appealed to
his imagination. It gave a deep romantic tinge
to the too matter-of-fact freckled nose and
hungry mouth. Besides the end was noble and
the end was Miss Jennie Tupper.</p>

<p>The new r&ocirc;le of course had certain exigencies.
To be an interesting reprobate and engage
Miss Jenny Tupper's sentimental proclivities
for redemption, it was necessary to present
some concrete evidence of a sinful life. He
was shockingly deficient in all the habits that
lead to the gallows. Desperate characters he
remembered (recalling the Doctor's terrific
sermons on the Demon Cigarettes which are
the nails in the coffins of mothers) usually
had their fingers stained with telltale traces of
the nicotine which was gnawing at their lungs.</p>

<p>He ensconced himself by the fireplace (out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
deference to Snorky's estimate of the governor)
and taking care not to inhale, smoked a cigarette
to the end. But the result was unsatisfactory.
He burned his fingers over the distasteful performance
but acquired nothing in the way of a
stain. He smoked a second and a third and then
seized by an inspiration carefully rubbed in the
moist ends.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When they walked back from the beach that
morning Miss Jennie Tupper lost no time in
opening up the fascinating subject of the sinful
one's reclamation. Skippy had just brought
forth a cigarette, tapped it professionally on his
wrist and said:</p>

<p>"Don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do mind," said Miss Tupper severely.
"Juth look at your hand. It ith thaking."</p>

<p>Skippy extended a palsied hand with the
second and third fingers yellowed like a Chinaman's.</p>

<p>"It's worse this morning," he said carelessly
with the sigh of one who contemplates stoically
the approaching end.</p>

<p>"It's tewible, tewible to let a habit make a
slave of you like that! At your age too! How
did it ever get such a dweadful hold on you?"</p>

<p>"I began as a boy," said Skippy slowly, for
he had still to work out the story. "You know
how it is. Fast company, money in your pockets,
no one caring. That's it, that's how it was."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>He raised the cigarette to his lips.</p>

<p>"Don't smoke it, pleath."</p>

<p>"Just one, just half a one," said Skippy with
a haunted look. "My Lord, it's been an
hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pleath for my thake, Jack."</p>

<p>He hesitated, swallowed hard, made one
or two false gestures, and flung away the
cigarette.</p>

<p>"If you ask it like that," he said huskily.</p>

<p>"I'm going to athk more," said Miss Tupper
with shining eyes. "I'm going to athk you to
pwomith never to touch another thigawette or
another card."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Skippy. "It's gone too far,
it's beyond me."</p>

<p>"But it'll kill you, Jack," said Miss Tupper,
alarm in the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>"I couldn't promise. I couldn't keep it,"
said Skippy, who had no intention of relinquishing
his dramatic advantage, "but I'll make a
fight for it. If you want me to&mdash;Jennie. If
you really care?"</p>

<p>The moon ripple and the fragrance of the
honeysuckle were no longer about them. Miss
Tupper in the calmer light of the day considered
her words with due regard to precept
and standard.</p>

<p>"I'll be vewy glad, indeed, to help you if I
can," she said properly. "We should alwayth
help ath much ath we can, shouldn't we?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"How coldly you say it!" said Skippy indignantly.</p>

<p>"But Jack," said Miss Tupper, alarmed at
the tragic look on his face. "Juth think how
little I know you."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," said Skippy with
magnificent generosity. "I don't deserve more
and I had no right to say that. Well it was
white of you even to care this much." He took
off his hat and extended his hand.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"The only square thing by you," said Skippy
with a perfect Bret Harte manner. "It's been
bully to know you and I'll never forget about
that stud. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Do you want to make me vewy vewy unhappy?"
said Miss Jennie with a reproachful
look in the velvety eyes. Skippy returned the
hat at once to his head.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything, anything for you," he said
huskily.</p>

<p>Now there are two stages in the process of
returning the wandering sheep to the fold and
not the least interesting is the period of investigation.
Miss Tupper had worked in missions
with enthusiasm but there was something
in the present case which staggered her imagination.
How could a boy of sixteen, brought
up with all the advantages of a home and good
influences, have sunk so deeply into the mire of
evil? How could one be so depraved and yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
look at you with such an open, winning smile?
Was he inherently bad or just weak, just reaching
out blindly for some good influence to set
him right?</p>

<p>"If I can help you," she said, leading the way
to a little summer house on the parsonage and
shuddering as she glanced down at the nicotine
stained fingers, "and I do want to help you&mdash;I'm
several years older than you are&mdash;you
muth tell me evewything."</p>

<p>"I will, I want to," said Skippy, summoning
up all the powers of his imagination.</p>

<p>"You know," said Miss Tupper, a little embarrassed,
"I heard, I couldn't help hearing
all you thaid that night on the boat."</p>

<p>"You did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good heavens!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't want to tell me."</p>

<p>"I might as well make a clean breast of it,"
said Skippy, wondering where the exigencies
of the situation would lead him.</p>

<p>"I'm afwaid Jack," said Miss Tupper sympathetically,
"that your fwiend Arthur Gween
ith not a vewy good influenth for you."</p>

<p>"Snorky?" said Skippy momentarily surprised.</p>

<p>"He theems to have vewy low athothiations,"
said Miss Tupper earnestly.</p>

<p>"You mean racing and jockeys and all that
sort of stuff?" said Skippy, willing to follow
the line of least resistance for a while. "Oh,
Arthur isn't half bad."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think you thee him ath he weally
ith," said Miss Tupper firmly. "No I don't
think he ith at all the pwoper perthon for you to
be with."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I help him?" said Skippy craftily.
"We should always try to help, shouldn't we?"</p>

<p>"You would have to be vewy vewy stwong
for that, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Skippy, with his mind
on the delicate arch of Miss Tupper's little foot.</p>

<p>Miss Tupper, who was expectantly set for an
interesting confession, was somewhat disappointed
at the lengthy delay.</p>

<p>"I'm afwaid your pawenth gave you too
much money," she said finally. "It ith tho
often that, ithn't it?"</p>

<p>There were some things that were too much
even for Skippy's imagination. In the present
case it absolutely refused to follow such a lead.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't that," he said slowly. After
all it is only the first one hundred thousand lies
that are difficult. Skippy's hesitation was brief.
He remembered the episode of the fictitious
Tina Tanner that had so often served him in
delicate moments.</p>

<p>"I almost made a wreck of my life," he began,
frowning terrifically.</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Miss Tupper eagerly.</p>

<p>"She wasn't a bad sort; only,&mdash;well stage
life is different."</p>

<p>"Stage life! You mean&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was an actress," said Skippy nodding.</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ran away from home. They never understood
me. Family fight. Swore I'd never set
foot in the old house again. Cut for the
West. You get to see a rough side of life like
that you know, mining camps, mule drivers,
lumber men. Good sorts," he added reflectively,
"but wild, very wild. You couldn't
understand."</p>

<p>"But your father and mother?" said Miss
Tupper, wide-eyed and thoroughly thrilled.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say anything against them,"
said Skippy magnanimously.</p>

<p>"Poor boy!"</p>

<p>"I've kept pretty straight considering,"
said Skippy, who did not wish to paint the
picture too black.</p>

<p>"And the girl?" said Miss Tupper, who
could not restrain a perfectly feminine curiosity.</p>

<p>"Tina? She wanted me to go on the stage
with her," said Skippy, who had now told the
story a sufficient number of times to begin to
believe in it. "It was touch and go. Well, I
didn't. That's all."</p>

<p>"What a dweadful thide of life you've
theen," said Miss Tupper, appalled. "At your
age, too!"</p>

<p>"I say, I never expected to tell any one this."</p>

<p>"But aren't you glad you did? Don't you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
feel better now that you've told the twuth!"
said Miss Tupper enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Skippy thought this over and acknowledged
finally that confession was a relief.</p>

<p>"Now pwomise never, never to gamble,
smoke, or dwink. Pwomise, Jack. You don't
know how much better you'll feel."</p>

<p>"I'm not strong on signing pledges and that
sort of thing," said Skippy cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh no, juth pwomise."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"Until you're twenty-one."</p>

<p>"I think it's better to promise what you're
sure you can carry out, don't you? It has a
better effect," said Skippy craftily. "Tell you
what I'll do. I'll make a promise for a year.
Only there's one thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll promise to try and cut out the smoking,
but it will have to be little by little."</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>"My nerves won't stand it," said Skippy,
bringing forth the nicotine-splotched hand.
"I'll do my best. I will, I'll do it for you.
I'll cut down to a box a day."</p>

<p>"A box?"</p>

<p>"Ten cigarettes, only ten, but I must have
ten," said Skippy hungrily. "But Jennie,
you'll have to help a lot."</p>

<p>"You'll pwomise then?"</p>

<p>"I pwomise," said Skippy, falling into the lisp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>He extended his hand and profiting by the
solemnity of the moment held it with the softest
and gentlest of thrills, while he said slowly:</p>

<p>"Ten cigarettes a day. No more. That's
my solemn promise."</p>

<p>"But the gambling?" said Miss Jennie, disengaging
her hand.</p>

<p>"That's another promise," said Skippy,
taking her hand again. "I promise for the
space of one year, never to sit in a game of
poker for money, never to shoot craps with
Tacks Brooker or Happy Mather.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Ith thith nethethawy?" said Miss Tupper
blushing and seeking to free her hand from the
not too painful embrace.</p>

<p>"I want to be sure of everything," said
Skippy retaining tight hold. "Never to frequent
race tracks, that's a promise too, or to
bet on the ponies, or to go into pool rooms."</p>

<p>"That's quite enough," said Miss Tupper,
glancing nervously up towards the veranda.</p>

<p>"But I haven't promised to give up drinking
and all that sort of thing," said Skippy
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Miss Tupper, in whom a slight suspicion was
beginning to grow as to the exact motives back
of the sudden conversion, hesitated, but finally
put forth her hand a third time.</p>

<p>"I promise," said Skippy, drawing a deep
breath and sailing away on perfumed clouds to
an invisible choir. "I want to make this something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
terrific; it's the most important you
know. I promise for the space of one year,&mdash;so
long as you care enough to answer my letters,
that's only fair you know&mdash;I promise never
to touch a drop of beer or ale, or whiskey, or
rum, or brandy, or sherry, or port, or.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Alcohol in any form," said Miss Tupper,
the color of the rambler.</p>

<p>"In any form. So help me God," said Skippy
slowly.</p>

<p>"There," said Miss Tupper, somewhat
thrilled herself. "And now don't you feel
better, much, much better for having done it?"</p>

<p>And Skippy answered truthfully,</p>

<p>"You bet I feel better."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Skippy, indeed, would have sworn to anything
just for the look that lighted up the velvety
eyes in the joy of salvation. It is doubtful
if he even heard half of the program of his
future existence. There was something irresistible
in the softness of her eyes and the fascinating
lisp. He was face to face at last with
a good influence. He had met, not the type of
girl that men play with lightly or madly for a
month or a day, but a woman, the kind rough
coarse men look up to as to a polar star, the
kind of woman you think of winning after years
of struggle, that keeps men straight and their
thoughts on higher things, the kind of woman
that pulls a drunkard out of the gutter, reclaims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
him and makes a genius out of the
wreck. He would be saved by her, he was
bound he would&mdash;no matter what sacrifices he
would have to make to keep in proper sinful
condition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sudden Interest in the Bible</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>SNORKY GREEN had experienced so many
shocks in his intimate contact with his
chum's imagination that he had come to believe
the future could hold no surprises for
him. But that evening Skippy after a long
searching through bookcases said with a worried
air:</div>

<p>"I say, Snorky, where do you keep the
Bible?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the Bible?" said Snorky faintly.</p>

<p>"Sure, the Bible."</p>

<p>Snorky's first thought was that Skippy must
be the victim of a secret malady and ready
to make his will. His next was even more
alarming.</p>

<p>"You're not thinking of anything rash, are
you, old horse?"</p>

<p>"What the deuce?"</p>

<p>"You and Jennie?"</p>

<p>"What the Sam Blazes are you driving
at?"</p>

<p>"Thought you were looking up the marriage
service," said Snorky facetiously.</p>

<p>"Shucks, no. Nothing of the sort. I just,
I just want to look up a reference."</p>

<p>"What reference?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's of a personal nature, very personal,"
said Skippy.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour's search Snorky finally
produced a Bible from the cook and watched
Skippy turn through the pages in a perplexed
manner.</p>

<p>"I've watched that coot do some queer
things," he thought, scratching his ear, "but
I'll be jiggswiggered if I can figure out what
he's up to now."</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour Skippy looked up
nonplussed.</p>

<p>"What do you know about the Bible, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I know a lot," said Snorky astutely.</p>

<p>"Where do you get the ten commandments,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>Snorky repeated the question, more and more
perplexed.</p>

<p>"Why it's in Genesis isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I looked all through that."</p>

<p>"How about Solomon? He was wise to
everything."</p>

<p>"Who was the guy who went up to Heaven?
Perhaps he got 'em."</p>

<p>"Let's ask the cook."</p>

<p>Which was done.</p>

<p>"Now what in the Sam Hill has Skippy to
do with the ten commandments or the ten commandments
with Skippy?" said Snorky, observing
the extraordinary concentration on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
chum's face as he considered them carefully
one by one. "Perhaps the heat has hit him and
he's going in for religion."</p>

<p>The explanation of Skippy's eccentric taste
was a perfectly simple one. No sooner had
he departed from the lovely presence of Miss
Jennie Tupper with only the vaguest idea
of what he had pledged himself not to do, but
with the liveliest and most disturbing memory
of the softest of hands, than he had bitterly repented
the prodigal manner in which he had
thrown away his opportunities.</p>

<p>"Why the deuce didn't I save something
out," he said to himself angrily, with a sudden
recollection of moonlight nights to come. "My
aunt's cat's pants, but I certainly went to
sleep."</p>

<p>From the parsonage to the Greens', from
the soup to the watermelon, but one idea obsessed
him: how was he to find something else
to swear off? For instinct, which supplants
reason in such sentimental voyages, warned him
that to such a professional reformer as Miss
Jennie Tupper his sole fascination lay in a
lively display of original sin.</p>

<p>The more he thought it over the more depressed
he had become. The truth was that he
had outrageously neglected his opportunities
and had little to offer. All he could do was to
fall back on his imagination and such knowledge
of the world as returned to him from an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
extensive preparation in modern fiction. The
trouble with his imagination was it worked too
spontaneously. How much better he could have
done with a little more preparation!</p>

<p>"Gee, I never knew a hand could give you
such a fuzzy feeling," he said with a heavy
sigh.</p>

<p>It was then that he had thought of the Bible
and the ten commandments with much resulting
perplexity to Snorky.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be eternally dog-switched," he
said all at once. "I never would have believed
it!"</p>

<p>"Believed what?" said Snorky, who was
waiting patiently.</p>

<p>"Say, these are the ten commandments,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'are't'">aren't</ins> they?"</p>

<p>"Sure they are!"</p>

<p>"Genuine, bona-fide, patent applied for, no
imitations, only original ten commandments?"</p>

<p>"Keerect."</p>

<p>"Well do you know there isn't a thing in
them about cigarettes, or booze or penny-ante.
Not a word!"</p>

<p>"Honest?"</p>

<p>"Read 'em yourself," said Skippy indignantly.
"It's all about being nice to your
neighbor and sitting still on Sunday."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Fact!" said Skippy, whose real irritation
was caused by the fact that the ten commandments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
did not afford him any suggestion in his
new predicament.</p>

<p>Suddenly Snorky slapped his shoulder with
a resounding whack.</p>

<p>"I'm on."</p>

<p>"Ouch! On to what?"</p>

<p>"Own up! I'm in the same box too," said
Snorky with a smirk.</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Margarita's trying the reform racket
on me too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is?" said Skippy, who did not like
sharing the honors of a stellar r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>"Yep, and you must have been laying it on
strong for Margarita's been asking all sorts of
questions about you."</p>

<p>"Snorky, go the limit&mdash;make it strong and
stronger," said Skippy, brightening up.</p>

<p>"Honest?"</p>

<p>"The limit!"</p>

<p>"I get you."</p>

<p>Skippy took a few steps towards the door and
reflected.</p>

<p>"When I say the limit&mdash;" he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me."</p>

<p>"There are some things though."</p>

<p>"Don't worry&mdash;trust me."</p>

<p>"Well, however, I say,&mdash;don't get rash."</p>

<p>"Keep on trusting me," said Snorky with an
airy wave of his hand.</p>

<p>Something in the repetition struck Skippy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
where he was the weakest, in that wholesouled
faith which should sanctify the friendship of a
lifetime. The more he considered it the less he
liked it.</p>

<p>"I have made a mistake," he said frowning.
"Snorky has no sense of discretion."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Way of the Transgressor</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>MISS JENNIE TUPPER at the end of a
week acknowledged to herself with an
uneasy sense of her own shortcomings that
the task of keeping Mr. Skippy Bedelle in
the straight and narrow path was one beyond
her limited experience. It was not that
she had lost confidence in her own efficiency,
but that she anxiously asked herself if she
could afford the time and the effort. Skippy
was all for the better life and yielded at
once to her suggestions. The trouble was
in his staying put, as it is colloquially expressed.
Each evening the cure was complete,
but each morning the conversation had
to begin all over. The hold that his past life
had taken upon him was simply staggering
and the hankering for the excitement of the
gambling table or the struggle against the
narcotic tyranny of the demon cigarette was
such that at times she had to sit long moments
holding his storm-racked and shaking hand
while he fought bravely against the maddening
appetite! And after a week of the closest
personal attention he had only cut down the
allowance of cigarettes to seven a day!</div>

<p>Now Miss Tupper was upright and God-fearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and self-respecting, and though there was
a difference of three years all in her favor, she,
unlike some of her sex, scorned the use of her
personal attractions, simply for the sake of a
personal vanity, nor was she a collector of male
scalps. She was in a moral quandary of the
most metaphysical complexity. What should
she do: shirk her evident moral responsibility
and allow a bravely battling human soul to sink
into iniquity or continue and permit a most
susceptible youngster to immerse himself
deeper and deeper into a hopeless passion?</p>

<p>Each day she came to the task of regenerating
Mr. Skippy Bedelle resolved to conduct
the proceedings on the grounds of the strictest
formality, and each evening she admitted to
herself the failure. Yet could she honestly
blame herself? She gave him her female sewing-society
pin to wear not as a personal token
but solely as a daily reminder of the promises
he had made to himself. She gave him a tie,
a colored handkerchief and the sweater she had
just finished for another destination. But each
was given as a reward and marked a triumphant
progress in his fight to acquire a final
mastery over himself. When, however, Skippy
brought up the question of a photograph, a
crisis was reached.</p>

<p>"I have never never given my picture to any
man," she said firmly, and the absence of sibilants
made it doubly impressive. "And I never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
never will. Bethideth, you know I would have
to tell my mother."</p>

<p>They were sitting in the summer house at
that romantic hour when the first day stars arrive
with the mosquitoes. It was always at
such moments that the craving was strongest.
She had begun by holding his wrist in a strong
encircling clasp but the sight of his twitching
contorted fingers had been too much for her
sensibilities and her hand had slipped into a
more intimate clasp.</p>

<p>"After all he's only a boy," she had said to
herself.</p>

<p>"Jennie! how can you&mdash;don't you&mdash;do you
realize all I'm doing&mdash;just for you?" said
Skippy, whose voice at such moments was not
under control.</p>

<p>"No, no, you ought to do it for yourself,
becauth it ith the right thing to do, becauth it
will make you feel stwonger and finer."</p>

<p>"Nope, it's you or nothing."</p>

<p>"Jack, you muthn't thay thuch thingth. I
muthn't let you!"</p>

<p>"It is the first time I've ever cared what became
of me," said Skippy lugubriously. "You
don't know what that pin means to me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you realize what I'm going back to?
Old associations, old habits and a long, long,
fight! And then there's Snorky. I've got to
save him too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Jack&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not asking for anything more than just
your picture, nothing more,&mdash;nothing that commits
you to anything! But I do want that, I
must have that! I want to rise up every morning
and remember and, and I want to come back
every night and know that I can face your
eyes," said Skippy warming up. "I say it must
be a full face, not a profile, you know."</p>

<p>"I haven't thaid I would," said Miss Jennie
in dreadful perplexity.</p>

<p>"But you will."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"You will, won't you!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I will think it over," said Miss Tupper
finally, remembering the terrific report which
her sister had brought her via Snorky Green.
"I will give you my dethition after thupper."</p>

<p>That evening, Skippy, excusing himself from
Snorky, who was taking Margarita to a lecture
on the fauna and flora of Yucatan, set out for
the parsonage with a thumping heart. If the
truth be told he was not altogether convinced
of the durability of his attraction for Miss
Jennie, but he was quite certain of one thing, if
there was even a sporting chance of Snorky's
adding the blonde sister to his photographic
gallery in the communal room in the Kennedy
House, he could never confess failure! The
state of his own emotion perplexed him. When
he was away, he could look on with a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
amused calm as though the whole thing were
but a fascinating game. Indeed, at times he
felt gorgeously, terrifically guilty, the gayest
and blackest of black Lotharios. Yet no sooner
had he looked into the soft velvety eyes and felt
the touch of her warm fingers than he was certain,
absolutely certain that his life's decision
had been made, that he wanted to stand forth
as a man of the strongest character, and slowly
and patiently struggle upward to those heights
where serenely she would wait for him.</p>

<p>He consumed three cigarettes&mdash;rapidly and
faithfully, to make up the seven of the daily
quota, mutually agreed upon; flicked the dust
off his shoes with his handkerchief, tightened
his belt and his tie, and, having fanned himself
with his hat, found at last the courage to tread
the noisy gravel and ring the bell. On his way
he had built up a dozen eloquent conversations,
but all memory of things tender and convincing
were forgotten as he ventured over the slippery
floor of the parlor and beheld at the side of
Jennie a large blown-up, thin-haired male
visitor in ecclesiastical black, who was introduced
to him as the Rev. Percy Tuptale.</p>

<p>Intuition is a strange thing that fortunately
returns to lovers, drunkards and children in
their hour of need. From the first touch of her
hand and the first look into her face Skippy
knew that a crisis had arrived. Mr. Tuptale
was so placidly and professionally at ease and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Miss Tupper so nervously and unsibilantly conversational
that the conversation bubbled on
like a kettle steaming in a distant room. He
nodded once or twice, Mr. Tuptale fingered a
magazine while Jennie ran on softening the s's.</p>

<p>"Something awful is going to happen,"
thought Skippy, staring at the biblical engravings
on the wall. "They're going to try to
make me give back that pin."</p>

<p>Miss Tupper stood up. Skippy stood up.
Mr. Tuptale stood up.</p>

<p>"Jack, I have taken a therious, a vewy therious
thep," said Miss Tupper flushing. "I do
want to help you tho much but, but I have
thought, that ith, I am afwaid I know tho little
how. You may think it dweadful of me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused and Skippy frozen to the marrow
said icily,</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I have gone to Mr. Tuptale&mdash;to Perthy for
advithe. I, I had to."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Skippy loftily. "Is Mr.
Tuptale, are you,&mdash;is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, yeth," said Jennie, blushing, while a
smile spread enormously over Mr. Tuptale's
features.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"You thee that ith why," said Jennie hastily,
"and, oh Jack, I do want you to talk to him,
juth ath you talked to me. Tell him evwything.
He ith tho helpful and tho underthanding."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>She swayed from one foot to another and
glanced from the boy to the man, undecided.</p>

<p>"Jennie, dear," said Mr. Tuptale with surgical
ease, "I think ahem&mdash;suppose you let us
talk this over together. It would be easier,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yeth, indeed!"</p>

<p>The next moment they were alone.</p>

<p>"And now my boy," said Mr. Tuptale
blandly. "Come, sit down. Let's have it out
like man to man."</p>

<p>Skippy did not at once comply. He walked
slowly around the red plush rocker and then
back to the bamboo fire-screen and rested his
elbows lightly upon it and glowered at the all-unconscious
curate, murder in his heart.</p>

<p>"Jennie is very fond of you, Jack," said Mr.
Tuptale, caging his fingers. "She has a warm
and sympathetic nature, a big heart, and I can
quite understand how deeply concerned she is
in the brave fight you are making. I want you
to accept me as a friend, a real friend. I know
men and I know what temptations are, early
associations, acquired habits. Jack, my boy,
there is nothing really wrong in you. I saw
that the moment you came into the room."</p>

<p>"Who said there was&mdash;pray?" said Skippy,
whose hands were trembling with rage.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuptale looked up quickly, frowned and
said:</p>

<p>"Jennie has told me all&mdash;naturally."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"She told you I gambled."</p>

<p>"She did."</p>

<p>"She told you I drank, and she told you I
smoked."</p>

<p>"She did, of course, and I consider it was her
duty to do so."</p>

<p>"Well is there anything wrong in that, I ask
you?"</p>

<p>"Anything wrong in gambling, drunkenness,
steeping oneself with tobacco until your hand
shakes like a leaf?" said Mr. Tuptale, rising.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Do you know your ten commandments,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Are you insulting me, sir?" said the curate,
yielding to a perfectly natural irritation.</p>

<p>"Kindly point out to me in the ten commandments
where any habit of mine is forbidden,"
said Skippy with the most impressive of declamatory
attitudes.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuptale's jaw dropped, twice he tried to
answer and twice remained inarticulate.</p>

<p>Skippy possessed himself of his hat and
bowed in scorn.</p>

<p>"You will kindly restore to Miss Tupper this
pin," he said, producing it after a struggle with
his tie. "Also inform her that I shall immediately
send back to her other articles I need not
now specify. Thank you for your interest in
my case but it is quite unnecessary&mdash;quite.
I can stand by the ten commandments. Good
night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>He went down the scrunching gravel and
slammed the gate.</p>

<p>"And there is more, sir," he exclaimed aloud,
forgetting that he was now alone. "One thing
more. You can tell Miss Tupper that even
among the lowest of my associates, gamblers
and drunkards and race-track sharks though
they be, a promise given is sacred, sacred, sir,
and the man who breaks it is, is, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here rage quite overtook him and he
picked up a stone and flung it at an inoffensive
tree.</p>

<p>"It's all Snorky!" he said in the swift progress
of moods. "I knew he'd overdo it! Holy
Mike, what in Sam Hill did he tell Margarita!
He must have&mdash;he&mdash;" But again imagination
failed him and he proceeded on his way, fists
sunk in his pockets, sliding along gloomy lanes.</p>

<p>"And I believed I had met a good woman!"
he said bitterly. "Faugh, they're all alike.
Well, I don't care what does become of me.
Serve her right if I went plump to the bad.
And by jingo, I'll do it too!"</p>

<p>Whereupon, having resolved upon a life of
crime, he plunged his hand into his pocket and
cast from him the now unnecessary cigarettes!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Scalp Hunter</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>SKIPPY in his sentimental progress had now
reached the point where if he could not control
the impulses of his sentiments he could at
least review the past with some instructive
profit.</div>

<p>"Girls are queer things, aren't they?" he
said ruminatively to Snorky Green, for the
mood of confidence was on him.</p>

<p>"Queerer and queerier," said Snorky, considering
the bosom of last night's dress shirt
with a view to future service.</p>

<p>"They get you before you know it and as
soon as they get you they worry the life out of
you. One way or the other they start to making
you miserable just as soon as you show
them you've fallen for them. Now why?"</p>

<p>"Woman has no sense of gratitude," said
Snorky, who had heard the phrase from a
brother who had suffered.</p>

<p>"And you can't be friends with them&mdash;well
you know, just friends."</p>

<p>"I know," said Snorky heavily.</p>

<p>"What gets me," said Skippy, "is why we
fall and fall and fall."</p>

<p>"Habit."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, habit, that's all."</p>

<p>"But this is the queerest of all," said Skippy,
yawning and stretching his arms deliciously.
"How darned fine you feel when it's all over.
You go to bed thinking the bottom's been
kicked out of things and you wake up feeling
so Jim dandy rip-roarin' chuck full of happiness
that you wonder what's happened, and
then you remember that you're cured! Your
time's your own. You can wear, do and say
what you like, spend your money on yourself.
You're free! Now it is queer, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Like having a tooth out?" said Snorky.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Say, what story did you cook up about me
to Margarita Tupper?" said Skippy, tying the
white cravat for the sixth time.</p>

<p>"Bygones is bygones," said Snorky evasively.</p>

<p>"You must have had me robbin' a coach or
skinning a cat," said Skippy encouragingly.</p>

<p>"You were throwing yourself away there,
old top," said Snorky, avoiding the direct
answer. "Why in another week you'd a been
reading little Rollo and taking to crocheting&mdash;a
girl who lisps like that, too! Whatever was
eating you, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"She talked like a shower bath," said Skippy
unfeelingly, "but her eyes were lovely. Well,
that's over."</p>

<p>"What's the use? You'll fall again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never," said Skippy firmly. Then he qualified
it. "That is, not in the same way."</p>

<p>"There ain't no two ways."</p>

<p>"Sure there is. It's like swimming. You
can dive in or you can sit on the bank and splash
with your toes&mdash;Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Wait and see. I know a thing or two."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, having assumed the
full glories of evening dress (with studs of the
good old-fashioned style that remained anchored),
they departed for dinner at the Balous
across the way.</p>

<p>"Say, put me on," said Skippy, who like all
artists of the imagination was seized with an
uncontrollable nervousness before facing an
audience. "Who's in the party?"</p>

<p>"Only Charlie and Vivi."</p>

<p>"Vivi?"</p>

<p>"Real name's Violet but she's dressed it
up."</p>

<p>"What's she like? What's her line?"</p>

<p>"Stiff as a ramrod&mdash;prim as an old maid,
conversation strictly educational."</p>

<p>"Well, what does she look like?"</p>

<p>"Flabby as a cart-horse."</p>

<p>"Say, what the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grub's o.k. and there'll be fun after," said
Snorky by way of justification.</p>

<p>"How's the old folks?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Balou? He's a terror, gives you the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
willies. If he doesn't freeze you the old girl
will."</p>

<p>Skippy's traditional scepticism of any statement
with the Snorky stamp would have warned
him at any other time. But this being in a way
a new experience in strange waters, his nervousness
got the better of him. Halfway up
the driveway he plucked Snorky's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Listen."</p>

<p>"Let go me arm you chump."</p>

<p>"What do you say to them?"</p>

<p>"Say to whom?"</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs."</p>

<p>"Talk about the weather, you ignoramus."</p>

<p>"Sure I know that, but afterwards, at dinner,
what do you talk about there?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, that's what girls are for."</p>

<p>Despite which advice, Skippy nervously ran
over his conversational ammunition. There
was of course Maude Adams to begin with.
He tried hard to think of some book he had read&mdash;some
work of sufficient dullness to serve up
to this blue stocking atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Stop shootin' your cuff," said Snorky, applying
his finger to the bell. "Don't you know
anything about society?"</p>

<p>"Who's nervous?" said Skippy indignantly.</p>

<p>His backbone stiffened to the consistency of
the white manacle that imprisoned his throat,
he brushed the slight powder of the dust from
the shining patent leathers, which in the fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the day extended in long pointed toes, shot
back his cuffs for the twentieth time, felt surreptitiously
to assure himself that his part was
functioning properly and slid behind Snorky
Green as he entered the parlor.</p>

<p>Something that was neither prim nor stiff
nor in the least resembled a cart-horse bore
down on them with a swish of ruffled skirts.</p>

<p>"Hello, Arthur, how nice of you to come.
Dad and Mumsy are out so we're all to ourselves,"
said Miss Vivi Balou. "Mr. Bedelle?
Oh I've heard a lot about <i>you!</i>"</p>

<p>"Really now, what do you mean?" said
Skippy, with a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>Miss Balou held his hand just an extra minute
as she said this, looking up into his face with an
expression of the greatest interest. She was
just over five feet, of the dreaded species of
brunettes, with a thin, upward pointing little
nose and the brightest of eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh I know a terrible lot," she said, giving
to her mischievous glance just the slightest,
most complimentary shade of apprehension.</p>

<p>Mr. Skippy Bedelle grew two inches toward
the ceiling and looked for a mirror.</p>

<p>Two strictly plain young ladies, roommates
of Miss Balou's from Farmington, with large
black sash bows in their hair, were introduced
as Miss Barrons and Miss Cantillon.</p>

<p>"Elsa Barrons is perfectly wonderful with
the dumb-bells, look at her forearm, and Fanny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
isn't good looking but awfully clever," said
Miss Balou in a whisper which was already
confidential.</p>

<p>Brother Charles now sauntered in and shook
hands with the magnificent condescension of a
sophomore.</p>

<p>"Have a cigarette before dinner?"</p>

<p>He flashed a silver case and tendered it to
Snorky, who being unprepared, hesitated, and
took one.</p>

<p>"Cigarette?"</p>

<p>"Love to but I'm in training," said Skippy.</p>

<p>Charles, having arrived at the age when
everything should weigh heavily upon a sophisticated
appetite, bored with his sister, bored
with sister's plain looking friends and bored
with sister's beaux, retired to the fireplace,
where he draped himself on the mantelpiece
and looked properly bored with himself, an
illusion of greatness which was peculiarly impressive
to tadpole imaginations.</p>

<p>The arduities of the opening conversation
were fortunately interrupted by the announcement
of dinner and Skippy, with Maude Adams
in reserve, found himself at table between Miss
Balou and the swinger of dumb-bells.</p>

<p>"You're a Princeton man?" said Miss Barrons
after several long breaths.</p>

<p>Skippy apportioned the compliment to his
manly air and the magnificent lines of the
dress suit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'm Yale. That is I'm preparing," he
said carelessly, and hoping that Snorky wasn't
listening he added: "Family didn't want me
to go in too young, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I know," said Miss Barrons with an
appreciative glance at his precocious brow. "I
think that's much better too. You don't have
half as good a time if you go to college too
young."</p>

<p>"Eighteen's about right," said Skippy in a
more mature manner.</p>

<p>The subject being exhausted Skippy counted
up the forks while his companion, to appear at
ease, asked for the salt to put in her soup.</p>

<p>"Do you know Jim Fisher?" she said suddenly.
"He's going to Yale next year."</p>

<p>Skippy did not know Jim Fisher.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you know a perfectly dandy
girl?"</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Alice Parks."</p>

<p>Skippy did not know Alice Parks, though she
lived in New York City. Likewise with a growing
feeling of his profound social ignorance, he
successively admitted that he did not know
Cornelia Baxter, Frances Bowen or Harry Fall.
Whereupon Miss Barrons abandoned him to
converse with Charles who did know Alice
Parks who was so attractive and Harry Fall
who had such a strong character.</p>

<p>"What the devil is there to talk about," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Skippy to himself as he fidgeted with the soup.
"What an awful bore society is."</p>

<p>There was Maude Adams, but how was he to
get to her?</p>

<p>"I'm just crazy about harps," said Miss
Cantillon, who was clever. "I think they're
wonderful."</p>

<p>"Harps&mdash;oh yes," said Charles Balou.</p>

<p>Miss Cantillon appealed to the table.</p>

<p>"Do you like them better than violins?" said
Miss Barrons doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh much better!"</p>

<p>"They're too big," said Snorky wisely.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the trouble. It's a perfect
shame too. They are too big to carry round but
they are so melodious. I don't like the piano&mdash;it's
so cold&mdash;"</p>

<p>While the conversation raged on the proper
classification of musical instruments, Miss
Balou turned from Snorky to Skippy and
looked him once more in the eyes with her interested
glance.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard a lot about you," she said
with a knowing look.</p>

<p>"Really now?"</p>

<p>"You're a perfectly ghastly flirt," she said,
lowering her voice. "You give a girl a terrific
rush for a week or two and then pop off without
even saying good-bye. Never mind though.
I'm warned."</p>

<p>Again the look, the interested look of trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to discover the secret of his fascination. It was
quite unlike the way any other girl had ever
looked at him. Other girls looked at you side-wise
or averted their eyes when they met yours.
But this was different. It was mocking, impertinent,
insinuating, but it did not displease
him. He saw that he had made an impression,
an instantaneous impression. He mystified her
perhaps but he interested her intensely. For
the first time he had conquered with a look.</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"That's telling."</p>

<p>"I'll bet I know."</p>

<p>"Bet you don't."</p>

<p>"Bet I do."</p>

<p>"What'll you bet?"</p>

<p>"Two pounds of chocolates against a necktie."</p>

<p>"Done, who is it?"</p>

<p>"Some one here."</p>

<p>"Nope. You've lost."</p>

<p>"Who then?"</p>

<p>"Some one who knows Dolly Travers," said
Vivi with a mocking smile.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Brute," said Vivi in the greatest admiration.</p>

<p>"Really I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now don't be modest&mdash;I hate modest men.
It makes it twice as bad. She's very attractive,
isn't she?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very," said Skippy, feeling every inch a
man.</p>

<p>"But she's rather young&mdash;for you, isn't
she?" said Vivi artfully.</p>

<p>"They put glasses on cows in Russia," said
Miss Cantillon importantly. She had a reputation
as a brilliant conversationalist to uphold.</p>

<p>This assertion woke up the table.</p>

<p>"Cows?"</p>

<p>"Glasses?"</p>

<p>"Fanny dear, how excruciating!"</p>

<p>Even the sophomore was surprised into expressing
his incredulity.</p>

<p>"Colored glasses on account of the glare of
the snow," said Miss Cantillon.</p>

<p>"Fanny!"</p>

<p>"Fact, in Siberia. I read it in the papers."</p>

<p>"Cows can't live in the snow."</p>

<p>"But Siberia isn't all snow."</p>

<p>"Most of it is."</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful the things she knows?"
said Vivi admiringly. "Do you like brainy
women?"</p>

<p>"That depends," said Skippy while he
stopped to consider. "I don't know any."</p>

<p>"Oh what a dreadful cynical remark!" said
Vivi with another admiring look. "Heavens,
I shall be frightened to death what I say to
you. I'm sure you're awfully clever yourself.
Perhaps I'll have a chance. Clever men hate
clever women, don't they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is certainly something about my particular
style of beauty that's bowled her over,"
thought Skippy to himself.</p>

<p>"Oh I don't know," he said, fatuously unconscious
of the virtues he conceded to himself.
"Dolly Travers was quite clever, you know."</p>

<p>"Brute!" said Miss Balou for the second
time.</p>

<p>"Oh come now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think about you?"</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think you'd be lots of excitement at a
house party," said Miss Vivi, shaking her head.
"Just for a few days. I think you'd give a girl
the grandest sort of a rush, but as for believing
a word you said&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Skippy, immensely
puffed up.</p>

<p>"It shows in your eyes," said Vivi with a
look of having at last deciphered the mystery.
"Besides, girls have spoiled you. You have
had things too easily. No wonder you're conceited."</p>

<p>Miss Cantillon was discoursing brilliantly on
a crow that had been struck by lightning in
Oklahoma and had fallen into a wheat field and
set fire to the grain, which had precipitated a
conflagration which had necessitated calling
out the fire departments of two counties.</p>

<p>"You're offended now," said Vivi in a contrite
whisper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some one's given you an awfully bad opinion
of me," said Skippy stiffly, frowning to
show the displeasure he did not feel.</p>

<p>"Well it's true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is not!"</p>

<p>"How about Jennie Tupper?"</p>

<p>"Oh that!" said Skippy burying the memory
with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"You see you <i>are</i> a brute! Well I don't
mind. I like your hands."</p>

<p>Skippy took a precautionary glance at the
ends of his baseball fingers and then allowed
them to come to rest on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>"Now you're trying to jolly me," he said
astutely.</p>

<p>"No. I always notice hands the first thing.
They tell so much about your character. I saw
yours at once."</p>

<p>"You can read hands?" said Skippy, who
knew this much of the etiquette of the game.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not now," said Vivi in a promissory
tone.</p>

<p>Skippy's attitude towards social functions
underwent a change of front. He began to feel
confidently, vaingloriously at ease. He joined
in the general conversation determined to rout
the brilliant Miss Cantillon, who knew so many
things. Now the rule for such pre&euml;minence is
simple and some acquire it by cunning and
others by instinct. Deny the obvious. Reputations
have fattened on nothing else. When inevitably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the moment arrived to discuss Maude
Adams, and her latest play, Skippy announced
that he did not like Maude Adams.</p>

<p>"Not like Maude Adams!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence and all eyes
were turned expectantly toward him as to a
manifestly superior intelligence. Finally the
swinger of dumb-bells voiced the question.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>Skippy considered.</p>

<p>"Too much like Maude Adams," he said
cryptically.</p>

<p>Vivi looked at him in admiration.</p>

<p>"How clever, I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm just frantic about Maude
Adams!" said the athletic Miss Barrons stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Because you like Maude Adams," said
Skippy as a clincher.</p>

<p>By one bold stroke he had become a personage
and what is more perceived that he had
become one. Different topics were served up
for his judgment. He pronounced flatly against
colleges for women, woman suffrage and bobbed
hair, predicted the election of Mr. Bryan and
the probable division of the United States into
four separate republics. Even Snorky Green,
who was floundering along on the subject of
blazers <i>vs.</i> sweaters, was impressed, and as for
Miss Cantillon, she tried to stir up a little commotion
by introducing the subject of The Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
from Narragansett who had removed freckles
by watermelon rinds, but the effect was tepid
and she relapsed into a listener.</p>

<p>"Say, where did you get it?" said Snorky in
a whisper as they passed out to the veranda.</p>

<p>"Get what?"</p>

<p>"All this bright boy stuff! Why you're the
little boy orator yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how it's done sometime," said
Skippy magnificently.</p>

<p>"Do you like views?" said Vivi, coming to
him as a moth to the brightest flame.</p>

<p>"That depends," said Skippy, who being still
in a mood of negation was unwilling to concede
anything.</p>

<p>Miss Vivi accepted this as acquiescence and,
it being early moonlight and dangerous underfoot,
took his hand to lead him safely around
the flower beds. Skippy having just discovered
the secret to success encased himself
in indifference and waited developments.</p>

<p>"Isn't it romantic! Don't you <i>love</i> it?" she
said, arrived at a little summer house that
jutted out over the darkling waters.</p>

<p>"It's rather nice," said Skippy, sternly repressing
his emotional tendencies.</p>

<p>Vivi now ostentatiously disengaged her hand.</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"Is it safe now?" said Skippy anxiously.</p>

<p>"How perfectly horrid of you," said the
young lady in pretended indignation. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
make fun of everything, even the most sacred
things."</p>

<p>The relevancy of this was lost on Skippy
who condescended to say,</p>

<p>"View isn't half bad if the moon weren't so
dreadfully lopsided."</p>

<p>"Unsentimental wretch! I suppose you want
to go back?" said Vivi reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Are there mosquitoes?"</p>

<p>"Just for that I'll keep you here until
you're eaten up," said Vivi, plucking a spray
of honeysuckle and inhaling it with a sigh.
"Isn't it wonderful, don't you adore honeysuckle
in the moonlight?" she added, transferring
it to his inspection.</p>

<p>Skippy inhaled it loudly and announced that
it was all right.</p>

<p>"Jelly fish," said Vivi throwing it away indignantly.</p>

<p>Skippy resented "jelly fish."</p>

<p>"Well you are! I never saw such a cold
calculating unemotional brute. You're nothing
but a great big icy brain."</p>

<p>Skippy thought of the Roman and a hundred
flunkings.</p>

<p>"Better pull in on the infant phenom&mdash;Snorky
might hear of it," he thought.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it here," he said in a more romantic
tone.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yep."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>A long silence and Vivi inhaled another sprig
of honeysuckle and devoured the moon.</p>

<p>"How long you going to stay?"</p>

<p>"About a week."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"You're so different."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Don't know but you are&mdash;quite, quite
different. You seem so much older than
Arthur."</p>

<p>"Well that all depends," said Skippy, ready
to draw on his imagination.</p>

<p>"You've seen a lot of life, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I saw that&mdash;in your hands."</p>

<p>"I say, how about reading my character
now?"</p>

<p>"No, not now, sometime later, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Well I don't know if I'd dare. What are
you doing to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular."</p>

<p>"Suppose we get up a hay ride and a picnic.
The moon will be glorious."</p>

<p>"Bacon and roast corn? Hurray!" said
Skippy, most unromantically.</p>

<p>Vivi got up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Let's go back."</p>

<p>"All right, but it's awfully dark."</p>

<p>"Follow me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Skippy walked purposely into the first flower
bed.</p>

<p>"Help, I'm lost!"</p>

<p>Vivi stood considering.</p>

<p>"Are you sorry?"</p>

<p>"Dreadfully. Ouch, I'm in a rose bush!"</p>

<p>"And you promise not to be cynical and
aloof?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart and hope to die," said
Skippy, very well pleased with himself.</p>

<p>Immediately the hand was offered and retained.
To be magnanimous he gave it a little
extra squeeze.</p>

<p>"That's not fair," said Vivi.</p>

<p>"All's fair in love and war," said Skippy
who, under the influence of outward conditions,
momentarily forgot his r&ocirc;le.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"My aunt's cat's pants," said Snorky enviously,
when they had departed. "You're
getting to be a rapid worker, old top, you certainly
are!"</p>

<p>"Oh I've learned a thing or two," said
Skippy pompously.</p>

<p>"Splash with your toes, old horse," said
Snorky, shaking his head. "Look out, Vivi's
an old stager. She collects them."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Scalps," said Snorky with a significant
gesture.</p>

<p>"Just watch me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't say so."</p>

<p>"I've got her feeding out of my hand, gentle
as a lamb," said Skippy, remembering with a
pleasant tickling sensation the mystified fascination
of her way of looking at him.</p>

<p>"Cheese it," said Snorky shaking his head.</p>

<p>"This is different."</p>

<p>"Whoa, old horse, whoa!"</p>

<p>"Snorky, old gal," said Skippy, who had
now settled down into the predatory vision
Miss Vivi had artfully evoked, "it's easy
when you know the game."</p>

<p>"And what's the game?"</p>

<p>"Don't get tagged."</p>

<p>"Elucidate."</p>

<p>"Keep 'em running after you. It's the first
one who runs away who wins every time."</p>

<p>"Oh, simple as that?"</p>

<p>"Sure, that's all there is to it."</p>

<p>"Let 'em love you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh well," said Skippy modestly, but as he
sought his bed he stole a satisfied glance into
the mirror.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Splashing With Your Toes</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>FOR the next six days Skippy was a very
busy young man. He had a reputation to
sustain. The reputation was quite unjustified
but that did not alter matters. Miss Balou
had given it to him and Miss Balou must not
be disappointed. In the shifting comedy of
life, Skippy was now cast for the part of
the Demon Rusher. In those early ambling
days before the automobile and the aeroplane
had brought their escape valves for human
energy, the steam pressure of youth sometimes
found expression in what was known as the
rush. As the name implies the object of the
male participant was to carry all before him in
cyclonic style, to dazzle and overwhelm the
breathless and bewildered lady by the blinding
rapidity of his showered attentions. By mutual
consent nothing binding was ever implied
in this form of acrobatic sentiment and the
knell was sounded when either party paused for
breath. When a rush began all bystanders
withdrew as a matter of etiquette and waited
for the dust to subside, much as, in the Simian
days of the race, the lesser monkeys sat on a
branch and hugged themselves when the big
monk came courting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></div>

<p>Skippy borrowed a bicycle and departed from
the home of his chum directly after breakfast,
having likewise borrowed various brilliant bits
of manly luxury which flashed from his ankles,
his neck and his breast pocket. At exactly nine
o'clock as though by accident Miss Vivi's trim
figure daintily balanced on the smartest of
"Safety" bicycles appeared from the Balou
driveway and the following brilliant opening
occurred.</p>

<p>"Why, Jack. What are you doing up so
early?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going!"</p>

<p>"Same place you're going."</p>

<p>"Who asked you?"</p>

<p>"You're going to."</p>

<p>"How d'you know."</p>

<p>"Somebody's eyes have told me so," said
Skippy in an unmusical treble.</p>

<p>Vivi pretended to be immensely offended,
Skippy was immensely concerned that she should
be offended. There was a long discussion
whether he had really offended, whether he
should be really forgiven and whether he really
intended to renounce such airs of proprietorship
in the future. By this time the two bicycles
were close together with Skippy's hands
on her handle-bars and the terms of peace were
concluded by the young lady condescending to
return to his appreciative gaze from underneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the lace brim of her hat whither she had
taken refuge. They bicycled along the beach
and Skippy expressed his wonder at the extent
of her wardrobe. Vivi then remarked appreciatively
upon his (or rather Snorky's) necktie.
The conversation then expanded, easily and
naturally along classic lines.</p>

<p>The theory was simplicity itself&mdash;who knows,
perhaps it has remained the same to this day!
For the twelve hours consecrated to each
other's society each day, Skippy denied what
Vivi affirmed unless it happened that Vivi
doubted what Skippy stated as a fact. There
were of course many ramifications, sometimes
it was a question of you did and you didn't,
sometimes it was and it wasn't, while any
future speculation was confined to you will
and you won't. As a matter of fact, nothing
that was said really mattered and each knew
it. Words were only so many verbal flourishes
in the most fascinating of duels. Each played
at the undying passion with open parades and
each was only secretly concerned with bearing
away the other's scalp.</p>

<p>They canoed together, walked together, picnicked
together, making only short public appearances
at the beach for the swimming hour
and the evening hop. When they came to the
club house they came late and danced together
on the porch to escape the exigencies of society.
If some unfeeling brute did arrive to claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Vivi, it was always understood that the next
dance reverted to Skippy, who meanwhile (this
was de rigeur) sat on the railing and looked
dreadfully dejected. It was all very serious
business, strenuous as training for the football
team&mdash;but Skippy never relaxed. He had a
reputation to sustain. Snorky gave him up for
lost. He no longer sought to warn him, but
each night simply as a matter of ceremony he
passed his hand solicitously over the shock of
stubby hair which adorned Skippy's elongated
cranium just to assure himself that the scalp
remained unbroken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Skippy Retires With His Scalp</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>CAME the last day. End of the summer, of
summer's warmth. End of languid siestas
on drowsy beaches, end of balmy moonlight
nights, moonlight sails, moonlight picnics; end
of intimate whispered half laughing, half serious
intimacies <i>a deux</i>. To-morrow separation
and a man's life to take up again! To-morrow
the chill of autumn and the melancholy of drifting
leaves. The last partings to take, promises
to be solemnly exchanged&mdash;heart burnings,
bottom dropped out of everything, another
milestone to be registered in the scurrying
flight of Time!</div>

<p>Mr. Skippy Bedelle and Miss Vivi Balou separated
themselves from the unromantic middle-aged
crowd around the tennis courts and made
their way up the beach to the sheltering swirls
of convenient sand dunes. They walked in
silence, oppressed by the greatness of their
grief, from time to time their shoulders touched
in dumb understanding.</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" said Skippy with a gulp in
his throat.</p>

<p>"Don't!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow&mdash;gee!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>He carried a beach chair, four sofa cushions,
two rugs, her work-bag, a box of chocolates and
a romance they had dipped into.</p>

<p>"Don't!" repeated Miss Vivi, gazing out
from under her pink parasol with stricken eyes
at the unending sea.</p>

<p>"To-morrow afternoon at this time!"</p>

<p>"It's been wonderful&mdash;wonderful week."</p>

<p>He made a back of the chair, spread the rug
and installed her solicitously. Then he camped
down not too far away, not too near, pulled his
cap over his eyes, locked his hands over his
knees and stared out toward the horizon that,
somehow, attracts at such moments.</p>

<p>A wind that was already cold played over the
frosty waves and sent little scurries of sand
twisting along the beach.</p>

<p>"Have a chocolate?"</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Jelly or nut?"</p>

<p>"Nut. Thanks."</p>

<p>They munched in silence.</p>

<p>"That's the trouble with summer," said
Skippy at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's rotten."</p>

<p>"Oh why must everything end?" said Vivi
wildly.</p>

<p>"I can't realize that to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll forget, men always forget."</p>

<p>Skippy shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. You'll write a letter or two and then
heigh ho!"</p>

<p>"Look here, you don't mean that," said
Skippy, turning on her.</p>

<p>Vivi's eyes dropped before his righteous
indignation.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no I don't mean that."</p>

<p>"Then don't talk that way&mdash;especially just
now."</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;Jack?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You do forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You're going to do wonderful things at
school," said Vivi, trying to be brave, "and I'm
going to be so proud to think I know you."</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll let you come down to
the Andover game?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about the game&mdash;but the
Prom!"</p>

<p>"Gee, you'll be a knockout there!"</p>

<p>They ate more chocolates, while Skippy debated
how to lead the conversation into the
softer strain before bestowing on the object of
his affections (for value exchanged, of course)
the sacred emblem of the Philomathean Debating
Society and bringing forth the Lawrenceville
banner which was tightly folded up
in his bulging hip pocket.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll go back now to Dolly
Travers," said Vivi, whose appetite for verbal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
expressions of sentiment was still far from
being satisfied. "And forget all about&mdash;about
this wonderful week."</p>

<p>"Women are fickler than men," said Skippy
gloomily.</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;not always."</p>

<p>"Don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Out of sight out of mind."</p>

<p>"You know better than that," said Skippy,
digging into his change pocket for the pin.</p>

<p>"How do I know?" said Vivi encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" Suddenly Skippy remembered.
His fingers relaxed on the pin. He
brought forth his hand. "Say, you promised
to read my hand you know."</p>

<p>"Did I?"</p>

<p>"Sure you did."</p>

<p>Miss Vivi sat up and carefully pillowed the
squat calloused hand in her soft one. For a
moment she studied it, turning it over and back
again, running her finger meditatively over the
mounds and depressions.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Skippy anxiously.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell all?"</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>"You have a very strong will&mdash;very obstinate
and not easily influenced. Ambition
will be your god and you will sacrifice&mdash;" Vivi
hesitated.</p>

<p>"I say, go on."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"So far is true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, pretty true," said Skippy, who began
to enjoy his portrait.</p>

<p>"You will sacrifice everything to your ambition&mdash;friends,
family, the woman who loves
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>"It's here in your hand," said Vivi, shocked
at the discovery. "Women will play very little
part in your life. It's not that you haven't a
lot to give, you have. See this bump, that's
affection. It's very developed."</p>

<p>"That's where I threw my thumb out of
joint," said Skippy doubtfully.</p>

<p>"But you've had a terrible experience in
your life that has shaken your faith and you are
afraid to trust again." Skippy looked the picture
of gloom at this and thought bitterly on
Mimi Lafontaine after hesitating once or twice
on the backward journey. "This has made you
cynical and cold, ready to impute the lowest
motives. Women will love you&mdash;many women,
but you will give your heart only once more&mdash;and
that&mdash;<i>that</i> will be a tragedy, on account of
your own lack of faith."</p>

<p>"Say, is all that there?" said Skippy, beginning
to be alarmed.</p>

<p>"That and more," said Vivi, warming up.
"You are very loyal, not at all conceited, brilliant
intellectual qualities and you will make a
success&mdash;" Here Vivi paused and turned his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
hand over, studying it carefully. "I see railroads
and banking in your hand."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Skippy unconvinced.</p>

<p>"There it is. You will make loads and loads
of money."</p>

<p>"I say, do I get married?"</p>

<p>"That is not quite clear," said Vivi frowning.
"This looks like it&mdash;but again this line&mdash;the
cold calculating streak in your nature&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment, from down the beach, came a
shrill whistle imitative of the whip-poor-will,
insistent, querulous and repeated.</p>

<p>Vivi dropped his hand and glanced hastily at
her watch.</p>

<p>"Good heavens, it's four o'clock!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'm on. Who's the little bird?"
said Skippy, who had not heard himself described
as the acme of suspicion for nothing.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>The whip-poor-will rose to shriller heights.</p>

<p>"It's Charlie Brownrigger," said Vivi, trying
to appear embarrassed, "and he's come
round to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed."</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> to let him say good-bye," said Vivi
imploringly to the young sultan. "I've treated
him abominably since you came. I can't be
rude to a chap, can I? I'll be right back."</p>

<p>"How long's it going to take?" asked
Skippy, drawing out his watch.</p>

<p>"Oh about twenty minutes," said Vivi.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll wait exactly half an hour. Four-thirty
to the minute. Not a second more."</p>

<p>"I do believe you're jealous, Jack Bedelle!"
said Vivi expectantly.</p>

<p>"Jealousy has no part in my nature," said
Skippy loftily. "Besides you can see it in my
hand. Firmness, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Brute!" said Vivi with a killing glance.</p>

<p>She picked up the pink parasol and hastened
down the beach. Skippy fished out the Philomathean
Debating Society pin and slowly attached
it to his vest. He switched to the
vacated place with the back rest and began to
whistle to himself. At the end of a seeming
hour he glanced at his watch. Exactly seven
minutes had elapsed.</p>

<p>"Half an hour was a mistake. Fifteen
minutes is enough for a mut like Brownrigger.
I should have been firmer. When a girl gets
you to waiting for her&mdash;she has you going and
coming. Firmer, I should have been much
firmer!"</p>

<p>He slipped off his shoes to empty them of
sand, and in doing so filled the gayly coloured
work-bag that was Vivi's. His toilette finished,
he took up the bag to clean it in turn. At the
first touch as fate had decreed a book tumbled
out and lay with opened pages before him. It
looked most suspiciously like a diary. He
averted his eyes and then his glance came
slowly back to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, that's not square," he said to himself
angrily, torn by a mighty temptation. He
leaned over and closed the book abruptly. The
next moment he was staring at three gilded
words that confronted him with the suddenness
of Belshazzar's vision:</p>

<div class='center'>
THE CHAP RECORD<br />
</div>

<p>A sudden brain storm swept over the emotional
nature of Mr. Skippy Bedelle, of the sort
which in modern legal etiquette is held to excuse
all crimes. He knew what a chap record
was. He had found one in his sister Clara's
bureau and had been lavishly paid for his
silence. He opened it violently and this is what
he read:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry Felton.</span> June 30-Sept. 6th. Good-looking
in a soapy sort of way, but dull: Good
dancer, agonizingly slow at a twosing. Takes
what you give him and is grateful. Good for
last minute calls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joe Randolph.</span> July 2d-August 6th. Awfully
lavish and liberal. Spoiled and hard to keep in
place. Useful later. Salt away for College
Prom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Brownrigger.</span> Xmas to&mdash;. Terribly
proper and easily shocked. Every girl
an angel. Seeking a good influence. Good only
for concerts and lectures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie Duler.</span> Easter vacation. Professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
flirt. Tried hard for him but no go. On
to all the old tricks. Too much alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hector Chisolm.</span> May 3 to May 6th. Three
day rush fast and furious. Nice teeth and eyes,
cold English style in daytime but wilts rapidly
in the moonlight. Dreadfully exciting. Au
revoir!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Having thus wandered through the carnage,
Skippy braced himself and read:</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Bedelle.</span> August 20th&mdash;Dreadfully
young and conceited, feed him on flattery&mdash;nice
eyes but funny nose&mdash;poor conversationalist
but works hard. Dreadful dancer. Pretends
indifference but awfully soft in spots.
Hooked him in twenty minutes&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Skippy laid the book down in his lap and
glanced up the beach which showed no signs
of an advancing parasol. Then he looked at his
watch which indicated exactly the half hour.
He sat a long moment thinking. Then he
opened the book and at the paragraph devoted
to him he added:</p>

<div class='center'>
<i>"Easy to hook is hard to hold."</i><br />
</div>

<p>But this did not satisfy him. He stood up
and suddenly inspired sunk to his knees and
hurriedly gathered together the sand into a
mound capable of burying Miss Vivi's little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
body. Across it he laid the opened book. At
its head he placed the box of chocolates as a
headstone. Then below he wrote in the sand
(symbol indeed of transient loves):</p>

<div class='center'>
SACRED TO THE MEMORY<br />
OF<br />
VIOLET BALOU<br />
SLAIN BY HER OWN HAND<br />
August 27th, 1896.<br />
</div>

<p>Then as a masterly afterthought he added
savagely:</p>

<div class='center'>
GONE AND NOW FORGOTTEN<br />
</div>

<p>Mr. Skippy Bedelle then wriggled away
through the sand dunes just as Miss Vivi Balou
with malice aforethought came up the beach
accompanied by Mr. Charles Brownrigger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Philosophical Attitude</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>IT happened on the day before school opened; at
that moment when Skippy returning from his
first sentimental summer had no other thought
than to rest up from the fatigue of the vacation
and devote his activities to the serious business
of life. There were the freshman (a discouraging
lot) to be properly educated, taught to punctuate
their sentences with a humble "sir," "if
you please" and "thank you;" there was a
certain score to be settled with Al at the Jigger
Shop and the basis of a new credit to be argued,
there was the prize room on the third floor
overlooking the campus to be re-decorated with
the loot of the summer, and one crucial question
to be decided forthwith:</div>

<p>"Shall we start training now or gorge ourselves
for just one more day?"</p>

<p>"The Jiggers are peach, soft and creamy,"
said Snorky with a pensive look. "But we
should set an example you know, old top, and
all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Keerect, we must."</p>

<p>"I can see the crowd up at Conover's putting
away the pancakes," said Snorky insidiously.</p>

<p>"Be firm," said Skippy, returning to his
trunk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't only the Jiggers," said Snorky,
who sometimes practised virtue but without the
slightest enthusiasm, "it's&mdash;it's those &eacute;clairs&mdash;never
tasted anything like them, big, fat,
luscious, oozing with cream&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Skippy indignantly.
"Where's your house spirit?"</p>

<p>"Can't a fellow be human?" said Snorky in
an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>"All right, all right&mdash;but put your mind on
other things," said Skippy nervously.</p>

<p>He disengaged an armful from the bottom
of his trunk and spreading it on the window
seat, contemplated the touch of many feminine
hands with an expression that was as
cynically blas&eacute; as that of the traditional predatory
bachelor. Whenever Skippy found a
mood too elusive to be expressed in words, his
lips instinctively resorted to boyhood's musical
outlet. His eyes traveled appraisingly over
sofa cushions, picture frames, knitted neckties
and flags that represent those select institutions
where young ladies are finished off. He
began to whistle,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I don't want to play in your yard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I don't like you any more . . ."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"My, you're a cold-hearted brute," said
Snorky, in whom perhaps the spirit of envy was
strong.</p>

<p>"I am," said Skippy unctuously, "and I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
going to be brutier, take a tip from yours truly,
<i>Moony</i>."</p>

<p>He disposed of half a dozen cushions, draped
two flags and carefully placed three photographs
amid the gallery on his bureau.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's honorable?" said
Snorky resentfully.</p>

<p>"Scalps, that's all!" said Skippy with a
grandiloquent wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"I get you. Heart whole and fancy free
etcetera etceteray?"</p>

<p>"Every time."</p>

<p>"Since when?" said Snorky wickedly.</p>

<p>Skippy allowed this to pass, but having pensively
contemplated the effect produced by the
addition of Miss Dolly Travers, Miss Jennie
Tupper and Miss Vivi Balou to the adoring
galaxy of the past, he swung a leg over the
table and assuming that newly acquired manner
of a man of the world, which was specially
galling to his chum, announced,</p>

<p>"Snorky, old horse, you play it wrong."</p>

<p>"I do, eh?"</p>

<p>"You do. There's nothing in that fussing
game. Women, my boy, are our inferiors."</p>

<p>"Well, it took you some time to find it out."</p>

<p>"Keerect, but now I'm wise. Woman is like
a harp in the desert, played upon by every passing
wind."</p>

<p>"Where'd ye read that?"</p>

<p>"If you're going in for that sort of thing get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
promiscuous. The only cure for one woman
is another."</p>

<p>"You ought to know."</p>

<p>"Are you corresponding with Margarita?"
said Skippy suddenly.</p>

<p>"And if I am?"</p>

<p>Skippy shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"Woman&mdash;" he began sententiously and
just then fate knocked at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in if you're good-looking," said
Snorky, glad of the interruption.</p>

<p>The door opened and discovered a short bulbous
freshman, just a whit embarrassed as
freshmen should be in the presence of royalty.</p>

<p>"Oh well, come in any way," said Skippy.
"What's your name, freshman!"</p>

<p>"Potterman," said the rotund youngster
squeezing in.</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"What's the rest of it&mdash;the handle, the
nickname."</p>

<p>"Are we telling our real names?" said the
new arrival, cocking his derby.</p>

<p>"Green, get out the bamboo cane," said
Skippy solemnly.</p>

<p>"Oh well, they call me Hippo&mdash;sir," said
Potterman hastily.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, Hippo Potterman. Of course.
That's good, but we'll try to do better by you.
Where did they find you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Philamedelphia, sir."</p>

<p>"What's that you've got there?" said
Snorky just about to fall upon him bodily.</p>

<p>"Please, sir, it's a letter from Mrs. Bedelle,
your aunt."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Skippy with a feeling of
disappointment. "You know my aunt? Well,
freshman, you may give it to me. I permit you.
Advance. That's it. Curtsey. A little lower.
Better."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">Dear Jack,</span><br />

<p>My very dear friend Susan Potterman is sending her son
Cornelius&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Skippy frowned and looked up incredulously.</p>

<p>"Is your name really Cornelius?"</p>

<p>Potterman flushed like the rose and said with
a gulp:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it is."</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad."</p>

<div class="blockquot">son Cornelius to Lawrenceville. Please do everything you can
to make him at home and see that he meets the <i>best</i> boys.
His mother and sister will go on with him and I want you
<i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'paticularly'">particularly</ins></i> to be <i>very</i> nice to them.<br />

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Aunt Carrie.</span><br /></div>
</div>

<p>Skippy having read this twice, looked in the
envelope to make sure that a five dollar bill
was not enclosed, as all aunts should remember
to do, and transferred his gaze to the fidgeting
Hippo.</p>

<p>"H'm, first time at boarding school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Governesses before?"</p>

<p>Hippo, who had been recovering from his
first feeling of awe, roared loudly at this.</p>

<p>Skippy looked indignantly at this breach of
etiquette and reached thoughtfully for a tennis
racket.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," said Hippo hastily, "High
school."</p>

<p>Skippy considered him thoughtfully and
something told him that in the right-hand lower
vest pocket there was undoubtedly a certain
amount of round hard silver bodies and moreover
that this condition was not simply episodic
but chronic.</p>

<p>"That coot may be fresh but he is going to
do a lot of heavy spending," he said to himself
with conviction.</p>

<p>How he knew is immaterial. There is an instinct
that guides&mdash;some have it, some haven't
it. You can't explain it. Doc Macnooder for
instance could diagnose a pocket-book as keenly
as a surgeon. It's a gift, that's all. Skippy
possessed this gift.</p>

<p>"Mother just brought you in?"</p>

<p>Hippo acknowledged this with a look of the
greatest distress.</p>

<p>"Sister too?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, yes!"</p>

<p>Skippy looked at Snorky and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that profanity is a wicked,
wicked habit, Hippo?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Hippo's mouth started to swallow his ears,
then returned to rest at signs of a hostile
atmosphere. He swung from foot to foot,
looked sheepish, looked terrified and finally
blurted out:</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir."</p>

<p>"It is a wicked habit, Hippo, but we are here
to help you. It is very lucky for you that you
have come to the right school, where you will
meet boys of fine manly standards. Kneel
down, Hippo."</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go over to the bed and kneel down," said
Skippy in a voice of great sadness. "Don't
hesitate, Hippo. That's better. Now, Hippo,
I want you to reflect upon what a wicked, wicked
thing profanity is and I want you to ask God to
forgive you and help you. Silently, Hippo."</p>

<p>Hippo, who was green and fresh but not at
all green and gullible, went through the prescribed
program with the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better now, Hippo?" said
Snorky solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but I'd like a little more time, sir."</p>

<p>"Stand up," said Skippy frowning.</p>

<p>Hippo, unchastened, bounded to his feet and
saluted.</p>

<p>"And, Hippo, I'm afraid," said Skippy relentlessly,
"that you don't appreciate what a
mother's love means. Think how your mother
has watched over you all these years, think how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
she has scrubbed behind your ears, think of the
hundreds and hundreds of toothbrushes&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this, as Snorky gulped and barely converted
a laugh into a sneeze with a hurried dive
into the closet, Skippy abandoning his pedagogical
air said in a more natural tone:</p>

<p>"Well, Hippo, I shall want to talk with you
very seriously on this some other time. Your
manners are shocking and your morals worse,
but I am here. Don't worry. Meanwhile,
ahem, you can bring your family in to tea."</p>

<p>"Thank you, kind sir."</p>

<p>"Hippo, you are fresh."</p>

<p>"But you <i>are</i> kind, aren't you, sir?" said
Hippo with assumed innocence.</p>

<p>"Get your hat and wait downstairs," said
Skippy deciding to abandon the lighter tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Hippo?"</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't forget."</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"The curtsey, you know."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A quarter of an hour later Skippy and
Snorky with Hippo in tow started across the
campus to show their prot&eacute;g&eacute; the historic spots,
beginning with Laloo's where the merry hot
dogs whistled to one another in steaming cans,
by way of Bill Appleby's where ginger-pop and
root-beer waited, to the Jigger Shop where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Jigger cooled and Conover's where the pancake
sizzled.</p>

<p>Opposite the Jigger Shop the celebrated Doc
Macnooder, resplendent in a varsity sweater,
was surveying the hungry Jigger-fed crowd and
debating whether to go right up and pay for
his sustenance or wait a little longer and see
what might turn up.</p>

<p>"Well, Skippy, been inventing anything
new?" said Macnooder pleasantly after the
introductions.</p>

<p>"I say, Doc, I want to put it up to you," said
Skippy hastily, for he feared any reference to
bathtubs or mosquitoes might detract from the
respect which was essential in Hippo. "I'm
out for the scrub, you know, and what I wanted
to ask you was do you think training ought to
start now or wait until school opens."</p>

<p>Macnooder's mind scorned <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'subleties'">subtleties</ins>. It
moved by the shortest cuts to the practical
issue.</p>

<p>"Has he got the price?" he said looking at
Hippo.</p>

<p>"He has."</p>

<p>"Let's eat."</p>

<p>Macnooder looked appraisingly at Hippo,
whom Nature had destined to play at center
rush, to be mauled and cuffed and suffocated
under scores of scuffing, struggling bodies. A
flicker of sympathy should have stirred, but it
didn't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll need quite a lot of stuff," he said
pensively.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, Doc," said Skippy, winking
hard at his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. "Hippo's fitted out."</p>

<p>"How about fountain-pens or crockery sets,
or patent nail clippers?"</p>

<p>"I dote on fountain-pens," began Hippo.</p>

<p>"Hippo's under my protection," said Skippy
militantly. "We're sort of related."</p>

<p>"Oh well, let's eat then," said Macnooder
with a reluctant look.</p>

<p>"Don't take anything from that fellow even
if he gives it to you," said Skippy in a whisper
to Hippo. "Elucidations later."</p>

<p>Al had two attitudes of welcome, according
to the record of the books, one in which the hand
advanced impulsively and a smile broke from
under the shaggy yellow bang and another where
the hand remained in a stationary receptive
cup, or sometimes caressed the limp ends of the
mustache in a way most discouraging and disheartening
to the delinquent debtor. When Doc
Macnooder arrived, however, he paid him the
further honor to carefully close the glass cases
where &eacute;clair and fruit cake were waiting the
call to service, and braced himself against the
counter.</p>

<p>"Hello, Al," said Skippy affably, "here we
are again. Set 'em up four times."</p>

<p>"I see you and I see that there Doc Macnooder,"
said Al in an unconvinced sort of way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Set 'em up," said Macnooder in an encouraging
tone.</p>

<p>"<i>Who's</i> settin' 'em up?" said Al, resorting
to his toothpick.</p>

<p>Macnooder looked at Skippy, Skippy looked
at Snorky, then all three looked at Hippo.</p>

<p>"The pleasure is mine," said Hippo and with
a purse-proud gesture he flicked on the counter
a twenty dollar bill.</p>

<p>Al was not easily shocked but for once his
perfect manner left him. He glanced at Hippo
and then enviously at Macnooder.</p>

<p>"I didn't know they picked them as early as
that," he said enigmatically. "Doc, you'll be
buying this place in a week."</p>

<p>"I could buy it now," said Macnooder frowning,
"and Al, step to the back and have a little
business talk with me."</p>

<p>Al, having received payment and displayed
the Jiggers, left for the back of the store to
that secluded nook which had heard a hundred
explanations and supplications from the improvident
and hungry. Skippy, who despite the
new assurance of his public manner, was willing
to learn at the feet of a master, Jigger in hand,
moved into a position of eavesdropping.</p>

<p>"Nineteen dollars and seventy-two cents,"
said Al, coming to the point.</p>

<p>"Exactly what my little proposition comes
to," said Macnooder affably. "Tear it up, Al,
you'll do it sooner or later so why not now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the flim-flam?" said Al, who recognized
in Macnooder qualities of a superior
intelligence.</p>

<p>"I don't like the word," said Macnooder in
a pained tone. "I've got an idea and you're
going to buy it. Al, the Jigger Shop has had a
cinch, a monopoly, a trust. You fixed prices
and you've controlled the output. Now answer
me, yes or no. Have you ever paid out one
cent in commissions?"</p>

<p>"Get to the point."</p>

<p>"I will. I have an idea, I might say a brilliant
idea and when I say I like the idea better
than any idea I can remember&mdash;you know me&mdash;I'm
modest, but Al, it's a wonder. You'll
like it. No, change that line, you may not like
it but you'll respect it. Al, I'm going to let
you in, give you the first chance. Conover
would double the commission. Appleby would
go wild over it. But, Al, I'm giving <i>you</i> the
first chance."</p>

<p>"Nineteen dollars and seventy-two cents,"
said Al, making a motion to close his ears.</p>

<p>"Not a cent less," said Macnooder firmly,
who according to his manner, having produced
the proper hypnotic effect, now came to the
point. "Sit down, Al, if you won't sit down&mdash;brace
yourself. The idea's coming now and
the idea's loaded with dynamite. Suppose, I
say suppose, it was in my power to boycott
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>"God Almighty couldn't do that," said Al.</p>

<p>"Not as you see it&mdash;you're right there, Al,
shrewd and clever! Al, there are ten freshmen
in the Dickinson. Think hard now, the idea's
growing. Ten freshmen. Suppose,&mdash;I only
say suppose now that as a disciplinary measure
we should decide that no freshman could enter
the Jigger Shop say&mdash;well let's be moderate&mdash;for
the space of three months. We might let
them go to Conover's or Laloo's and then
again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Macnooder," said Al explosively, "when
they lead you to the gallows I'll be sitting right
up front if it cost every cent I have."</p>

<p>"Al, you grieve me."</p>

<p>"It's blackmail! It's extortion and blame
it I believe you'd do it."</p>

<p>"No, Al, it's not blackmail, it's not extortion.
If I came to you and said out and out,
flat, tear up that account of mine or I'll boycott
you&mdash;<i>that</i>, Al, that would be all you say."</p>

<p>"My Gawd, Doc, why do you waste your time
in this little place anyhow?"</p>

<p>"You see, Al, it's this way," said Macnooder,
smiling at the compliment, "I'm coming to you
as Macnooder your attorney, that's one person,
to use his influence with Macnooder the financier,
that's another person&mdash;I'm a lobbyist,
a paid lobbyist."</p>

<p>"Nineteen dollars and seventy-two cents,"
said Al in a fainter voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Al, I'm surprised and shocked. I thought
your mind leaped at things. You don't see it
yet. You're thinking in terms of ten freshmen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nineteen doll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"But suppose the Dickinson lays down the
law, suppose the Kennedy follows suit. You
saw what that fellow flashed, a twenty dollar
yellowback, a word to Skippy and the Kennedy
would follow. Skippy, you understand,
would have to be <i>protected</i>, you get that. Well,
what would happen? Every house in the school
would follow suit. What does that mean?
Figure it out. It means one hundred freshmen
multiplied by ninety days multiplied by at
least two Jiggers a fresh&mdash;per day&mdash;you know
how freshmen eat&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here, Skippy, terrified, tiptoed away.
Macnooder aroused in him the lust for gold and
he wished to retain a few simple ideals. He
signaled Snorky and Hippo and escaped up
the road to the home of the pancake.</p>

<p>"Doc Macnooder is a wonder but he's not,
well he's not quite the sort of chap you want to
associate with, Hippo. Understand?"</p>

<p>"I'm young but I'm not so green as all
that," said Hippo winking wisely.</p>

<p>"In fact, Doc's a sponge and you made an
awful break."</p>

<p>"I did, what's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have shown him that twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
dollar bill. He'll never let up so long as he
remembers that."</p>

<p>"Skippy's right, Hippo," said Snorky.</p>

<p>"What'll I do?"</p>

<p>"Leave it to us. We'll think out some way."</p>

<p>After a good deal of thinking, they returned
from a heavy performance at Conover's, laden
with a large creamcake, a half dozen &eacute;clairs, a
box of Huyler's and two pounds of Turkish
paste, after placing an order for tinned meats,
cheese, saltines and root-beer.</p>

<p>"I say, this sort of removes the lurking
danger, doesn't it?" said Hippo, searching in
his pocket for the last half-dollar.</p>

<p>"We'll store the grub in our rooms," said
Snorky solemnly, "and then there won't be any
danger at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, kind sir," said the irrepressible
Hippo, and only the soothing presence of
the layer cake against his breast kept Snorky
from a mood of wrath.</p>

<p>"If you've got to mother that little squirt,"
said Snorky wrathfully, once they had returned
to their room, "you'll have your hands full,
that's all I wish to remark. A fresher, nervier
little nuisance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nuisance is going to get a lot of mothering,"
said Skippy with a far-off look in his
eyes. "But remember, old dear, that's why
we're here. That's why the faculty invites us
to Lawrenceville."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Snorky as he stowed away the
purchases and arranged the &eacute;clairs on the tea-table,
"if we can keep him away from Doc Macnooder,
there's going to be a few compensations."</p>

<p>"Nuisance will neither be affectionate nor
familiar by this time to-morrow," said Skippy
grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>"Cheese it! Hide the towels&mdash;here they
come!"</p>

<p>A knock and then the voice of Hippo in flippant
familiarity:</p>

<p>"All right, Skippy, we're good looking.
Open up."</p>

<p>Skippy looked at Snorky and swallowed hard
while his right arm worked convulsively.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said with an effort.</p>

<p>The door opened and Miss Potterman triumphantly
entered his life. Mrs. Potterman
was there and Hippo with his impertinent
smirk but neither Skippy nor Snorky saw anything
else but that wonderful vision. Something
unbelievable had suddenly stepped out of
their favorite Gibson picture and was advancing
in a halo. Violets and daffodils began to
sprout from the carpet and birds sang in the
window frames. It was instantaneous and it
was terrific.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Love Plus Hippo</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>JUST as there are professional conversationalists
and professional sponges, Miss Potterman
was a professional beauty. There was
nothing accidental or temporary about her.
She was complete, perfect, and she knew her
loveliness. After five years' triumphant progress
in society she was accustomed to the petrifying
effect of her sudden presence on a
beauty-worshipping sex. She did not walk as
other mortals walk, but floated in fragrantly
and Skippy stood staring rock-still, as though
Hippo had flashed the head of Medusa. None
of which by the way was lost on the keenly
observant Hippo.</div>

<p>"I beg pardon, I'm Skippy," he said shaking
himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bedelle, isn't it?" said Miss Potterman
in the tones that angels are supposed to
employ.</p>

<p>Skippy saw no one else. In another moment
he was seated on the window-seat entranced,
dazed and blissfully content with his fate, docile
as the rabbit in the presence of the boa constrictor.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad Corny is in your house," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Miss Potterman with a smile in the irresistible
eyes. "You will watch over him, won't you,
Mr. Bedelle?"</p>

<p>"Will I? You bet I will!"</p>

<p>"You see he's my only brother and we didn't
want him to go to boarding school&mdash;not just
yet. That is, mother and I. Dad insisted on it.
I don't think he's always, well&mdash;quite appreciated
Cornelius."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Skippy, averting his
look. Even in the intoxication of her presence
he could appreciate Dad.</p>

<p>"You see, Corny's different from other boys,
Mr. Bedelle. He's more like a grown-up person.
He has a wonderful mind and such an
unusual personality. I don't want him to lose
it all and be just like every other boy. And
some boys, I'm afraid, won't understand him
just at first. You will look after him, protect
him, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'd promise <i>you</i> anything," said Skippy
recklessly, which is the privilege of sixteen in
the presence of twenty-five.</p>

<p>Miss Potterman smiled without surprise and
laid her hand gently a moment on his arm in the
deadliest of feminine gestures.</p>

<p>"Corny's told me how kind you have been
already."</p>

<p>Skippy looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"Indeed he has. Really he's quite fond of
you already."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, Sis," said Nuisance at this moment,
"hasn't Skippy got a whang-dinger of a
room?"</p>

<p>And he approached with the layer cake and
the &eacute;clairs.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful spread," said Miss
Potterman, "but really you have been too
extravagant!"</p>

<p>Something in Skippy's sudden look decided
Hippo to keep the secret, but he revenged himself
on the cake in a way that made his sister
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Corny, where <i>are</i> your manners?"</p>

<p>"'S all right. I'll buy another," said Hippo,
who then winked brazenly at Skippy.</p>

<p>"I'll murder him, I will," said Skippy wrathfully
to himself. "I'd strip the hide off him, if
it&mdash;if it weren't for&mdash;" Then he raised his
eyes and beheld the reason why, smiling at him
with perfect faith.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we've spoiled Corny just a
little," she said hesitating.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is there much of that dreadful
hazing?"</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes," said Skippy, who always
placed the proper value on his services.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I've heard such dreadful things
have happened," said Miss Potterman, thoroughly
alarmed.</p>

<p>"That's only when accidents happen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Accidents!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Miss Potterman," said Skippy
with the manner of a Grand Duke. "Fellows
do get rough sometimes, but I'll look after
him."</p>

<p>Miss Potterman again laid her hand on his
arm.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>She stayed but half an hour. The door
closed. The birds fled from the windows and
the daffodils retired under the carpet.</p>

<p>"Whew!" said Snorky explosively.</p>

<p>Skippy fell back on a chair and fanned
himself.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he said disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Women are our inferiors," said Snorky
wickedly.</p>

<p>"What eyes!"</p>

<p>"Woman is like a harp&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woman!" said Skippy rousing himself indignantly.
"You don't call that a woman!
That's Maude Adams and Lorna Doone and&mdash;and
the Gibson Girl rolled into one!"</p>

<p>"Don't blame you," said Snorky heavily.
"It ain't right to let anything as wonderful as
that roam around loose. Skippy, it's all
wrong."</p>

<p>"You're right there."</p>

<p>"Well," said Snorky reflectively, "she turned
up in time. We'd have had Nuisance ready for
the undertaker by the morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"My hands are tied," said Skippy glumly.
"I've promised."</p>

<p>"Me too, but how are we going to stick it
out?"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to treat Nuisance with
moral influences," said Skippy thoughtfully.
"It will be longer, longer and harder."</p>

<p>They dined with Miss Potterman at the Inn
and that and a walk about the campus under
the stars completed the devastation. Before it
was over Skippy actually heard himself called
"Jack," had shaken hands on an eternal friendship,
promised to write from time to time of
Hippo's progress and needs, agreed to defend
him from bodily injury and promised to accompany
him home for the short Thanksgiving
recess. The final touch came when Miss Potterman
sought to press upon him a large bill in
case Hippo should be perishing of thirst or
hunger.</p>

<p>Skippy put it away. It hurt to do so, it
choked him, but he did it.</p>

<p>"Not from you&mdash;I couldn't," he said
huskily. "I&mdash;well, I just couldn't."</p>

<p>That night as he stood at his bureau and
looked into the eyes of the past, at Mimi and
Dolly and Jennie and Vivi the hunter of scalps,
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Snorky?"</p>

<p>"What is it, old boy?"</p>

<p>"Ever go fishing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"You betcha."</p>

<p>"Do you know the feeling after you've been
dabbling with six-inch and five-inch and four-inch
trout all day,&mdash;and something about three
feet long weighing ten or twelve pounds grabs
your hook? Do you get me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I get you," said Snorky gazing
heavily out at the stars, "but oh gee, Skippy,
why does she have to be Nuisance's sister?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Snorky's worst forebodings were realized.
Nuisance earned his title a hundredfold within
the week. Dennis de Brian de Boru Finnegan
had been fresh, was fresh and would freshen
more, but Dennis was amusing and added to the
gayety of nations. Nuisance was what his name
implied, simply intolerable. You stumbled over
him and you bumped into him. When state
secrets were being discussed in whispers,
Nuisance was always within earshot. He was
the extra, the intruder, the tail to the kite. He
did not actively offend against the traditions
which govern freshmen in the incubator period.
He was too clever for that. He had submitted
to the mild hazing with a cheerfulness which
robbed it of all its sting. He had climbed water
towers and sung appropriate hymns. He had
sat in washbasins and gravely pulled imaginary
miles against the toothpicks furnished him as
oars. He had submitted to the pi's as they
came with a full recognition that the second and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
third men in the mounting heap were extremely
more uncomfortable than himself with a mattress
for a vis-&agrave;-vis. He was not insubordinate&mdash;he
was just a nuisance.</p>

<p>But if he kept skilfully within the letter of
the law so far as the rest of the house was concerned
he was irrepressible once in the company
of Skippy. Nothing that Skippy could do
could chill his affection or bring him to a proper
realization of the deference which should mark
the manner of a freshman towards one of the
lords of the earth.</p>

<p>"Nuisance is like a wet muddy Newfoundland
pup that wants to live in your lap," said
Snorky at the end of the second week.</p>

<p>"Some day," said Skippy shaking his head,
"my worse nature is going to rise up and get
the better of me."</p>

<p>"I hope I see it!" said Snorky enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll have to hold in until after
Thanksgiving," said Skippy disconsolately.</p>

<p>"What? Oh, naturally."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Reality Minus Hippo</span></h3>


<div class='cap'>THANKSGIVING over, Snorky confidently
waited the explosion.</div>

<p>"Skippy's going to the bad," he said to
Dennis de Brian de Boru Finnegan. "He's
nervous, he's fidgety, he talks in his sleep.
There's no living with him."</p>

<p>"Some day it'll come," said Dennis cheerfully.
"Some day there'll be a bang-up, two
by two procession, slow music, flowers omitted;
and right on a nice green shutter will be
stretched our Sister's darling boy."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm getting tired of waiting."</p>

<p>"Keep hoping," said Dennis wisely. "Human
nature is human nature. Say, look at
that!"</p>

<p>Across the campus came Skippy, fists sunk in
his pockets, hat-brim down, stalking rapidly,
and at his heels the irrepressible Nuisance.</p>

<p>"It's shocking," said Snorky, "poor old
Skippy!"</p>

<p>"That's what love means," said Finnegan
contemptuously. "Do you know what he reminds
me of? A poor lonely cur going down
the road with a tin can tied to his tail."</p>

<p>"Hello, Skippy," said Snorky sadly.</p>

<p>Skippy looked at them and grunted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment Nuisance caught him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Say, old chap, what are you going to do
now?"</p>

<p>"Going to bed, damn it!" said Skippy and
bolted within.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>How could Snorky and Dennis that unworldly
fledgling know what Skippy suffered? The
forty-eight hours of the Thanksgiving vacation
had been like a narcotic dream. He had been
under the same roof with her, sat by her side
in the darkened theatre and thrilled at the low
sobby music that sent his imagination helter-skelter
into dangerous pastures; received her
confidences, gravely discussed with her the
character and eligibility of older men, confided
in turn his life's project to launch mosquito-proof
socks on a world scale; received the full
force of her lovely radiant gentlest of smiles;
danced with her alone a whole hour in the
Potterman ballroom, suffocated with happiness;
and for all of which had promised what?
To wear Nuisance about his neck like a millstone,
to protect, cherish and guide him through
the perils and temptations of boarding-school
as though&mdash;as though he were his own brother.
And Nuisance knew! That was the worst of
it,&mdash;Nuisance knew the thin tyrant skein by
which he held him irrevocably linked! Christmas
was yet to come and for what Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
might hold Skippy possessed his soul in
patience.</p>

<p>Then the blow fell. A week later as Snorky
Green was returning from the village he perceived
Dennis de Brian de Boru in a state of
excitement waving a newspaper at him from
the porch.</p>

<p>"There must be another birth in the faculty,"
thought Snorky, puzzled to ascribe an adequate
reason. Such events, be it mentioned, were
usually attended by cuts and in the higher
spheres with even a half holiday.</p>

<p>Finnegan rushed forward, dove at his knees
and spilled him on the ground joyously.</p>

<p>"Damn you, you mad Irishman," said
Snorky picking himself up and disentangling
himself from the newspaper. "What's hit you
anyway?"</p>

<p>"It's come, hooray!"</p>

<p>"What's come?"</p>

<p>"Skippy's free!"</p>

<p>Snorky, further mystified, seized Finnegan
and having sufficiently shaken him demanded an
explanation.</p>

<p>"Eighth page, first column, ouch!" said
Finnegan.</p>

<p>Snorky opened it and read:</p>

<div class='center'>
MISS POTTERMAN TO MARRY<br />
HAROLD B. DRINKWATER<br />
</div>

<p>At this moment the door opened and Skippy
came heavily out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you seen it?" said Dennis breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Seen what?"</p>

<p>"The paper!"</p>

<p>"What's in the paper?"</p>

<p>Dennis glanced at Snorky and solemnly
handed over the fatal announcement. All levity
had disappeared. A man's sorrow after all
must be sacred.</p>

<p>Skippy read and suddenly put down the
paper. Only two things came to his mind&mdash;wedding
immediate and she had not even written
him.</p>

<p>At this most auspicious moment, Nuisance
came gamboling around the house.</p>

<p>"Hi, Skippy, old sport, what ye doin'?"</p>

<p>Dennis de Brian de Boru looked at Snorky
and then simultaneously each sat down and retired
into an expectant audience.</p>

<p>Nuisance frolicked enthusiastically up for his
victim and then stopped. He had just caught
Skippy's expression. He stopped and suddenly
looked at the ground. He <i>knew!</i></p>

<p>Slowly, carefully, warily with his eyes on
Skippy he began a strategic withdrawal.
Skippy moved stealthily forward, picking up
his steps as a rat terrier does. Nuisance slunk
away, calculating the distance to the corner of
the house. Skippy increased the pace, drawing
ominously nearer.</p>

<p>Then Finnegan's shrill voice cried:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sic him, Skippy!"</p>

<p>The next moment, Nuisance, panic-stricken,
was scuttling for his life, with Skippy roaring
at his heels.</p>

<p>And just back of the lonely stretches of the
Dickinson, Skippy fell upon him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That night Skippy, wise by disillusionment,
confided his sorrows to a diary which began as
follows:</p>

<p>"What I don't know about women, ain't
worth knowing. Resolved; if any loving is
going to be done, they can do the loving."</p>

<p>But that of course is still another story.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
